* I have made some changes to the repositories in the default ALP image.  Now the image includes two repositories: The ALP repo now newly points to the published repository; https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/SUSE:/ALP:/PUBLISH/images/repo/ALP-0.1-x86_64-Media1/ It is only a subset of the build repository and basically an equivalent of the POOL repository known from other products; it will also be static until we release the next prototype; the other, by-default-disabled repo (ALP-Build) is the repository used for building the project and, and it is disabled by default. It uses all packages built in SUSE:ALP and will be moving forward over the time with any updates.
