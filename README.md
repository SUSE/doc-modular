Modular Documentation
=====================

This is the source of the official SUSE modular documentation. The repository currently covers the SLE 16 product family, SUSE Linux Micro and SUSE AI.

# What is this about?

Smart Docs represent a modular approach to documentation whose goal is producing sets of adaptable, solution-based, easy-to-find and reusable documents.

Rather than covering a complete technology or a set of problems, each Smart Docs article serves one distinct purpose. Each article stands for itself, including requirements, context, instructions, troubleshooting and FAQs.

Smart Docs consist of topicsâ€”smaller information units that can be reused in different contexts. Four different topic types are provided:
   * Task (how to?) - [XML template](https://github.com/SUSE/doc-modular/blob/main/templates/tasks/task.xml)
   * Concept (what is?) - [XML template](https://github.com/SUSE/doc-modular/blob/main/templates/concepts/concept.xml)
   * Reference (e.g. list of options, table with config files, default settings) - [XML template](https://github.com/SUSE/doc-modular/blob/main/templates/references/reference.xml)
   * Glue (combines texts or structures that do not fit into any of the other categories): Typical glue topics include the "For more information" and the "What's next" sections. Also use glue topics to add an additional layer of navigation to your article. - [XML template](https://github.com/SUSE/doc-modular/blob/main/templates/glues/glue.xml)

Articles are built by bundling these topics into assembly files - organizational units to structure the topics to create a coherent and meaningful document [XML template](https://github.com/SUSE/doc-modular/blob/main/templates/articles/assembly.xml).

# Tools

To build documents, DAPS version 4.X and geekodoc are needed. To install the requried tools, proceed as follows:

1. Add the documentation zypper repository:

    `sudo zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Documentation:/Tools/ Documentaton:Tools`

2. Refresh your repositories:

    `sudo zypper ref`

2. Install daps and geekodoc:

    `sudo zypper in daps geekodoc`
