    <title>Why care about the security of AI applications?</title>
    <para>
      AI applications use AI-driven chatbots to interact with users. These
      chatbots are powered by large language models (LLMs) and can process
      external data sources (RAGs). Such applications are prone to cyber attacks
      as any other software solutions. Attackers may impersonate users and apply
      a series of techniques to steal data and to corrupt the responses provided
      by AI models.

    <title>Which &productname; components are prone to attacks</title>
    <para>
      Users interact with &productname; via the &owui; user interface.
      With &owui;, you can manage users, permissions, AI models, knowledge
      bases, and chat interactions. The following &productname; components
      are the most susceptible to security attacks:

          <para>
            &owui; enables you to specify external data sources to improve
            responses. On a user level, you can append documents directly to the
            chat input field. With administrator privileges, you can upload
            documents to create a knowledge base that enhances the AI model. The
            knowledge base acts as a domain specific augmentation tool for the
            LLM. It prevents chatbot hallucination and improves the model's
            responses with accurate and up-to-date information.

              Actions performed by users&mdash;both the administrators and
              guests&mdash;are logged into an audit log. With the audit log, it
              is possible to map all actions that took the system to its current
              state.

            knowledge base concept. Although the user interaction normally takes
            place via &owui;, attackers may bypass &owui; to interact
            with &milvus;. This can happen if no identity access management
            (IAM) policy is controlling database access.

            Therefore, &ollama;'s API should not be exposed without a an element

            A common exploit when a knowledge base&mdash;often a vector
            database&mdash;that provides context for the AI model responses, is
            corrupted by the addition of documents with misleading, false or
            even harmful content. The malicious documents tend to be crafted
            specifically to provide wrong answers for a set of user prompts.
            This kind of attack usually requires access to a user with
            privileges to configure the whole platform or the vector databases
            that support the platform.

      To avoid having your system corrupted, there are a few security measures
      that need to be properly implemented. &owui; and &milvus; allow high
      level user access configurations. Besides these high level configurations,
      provide access management with low level network configurations. To verify
      that your whole AI stack is secure, consider the following points:
