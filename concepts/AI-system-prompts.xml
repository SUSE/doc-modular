    <title>What is a system prompt?</title>
    <para>
      System prompts are an important component in any AI, especially LLMs. They
      determine the way AI models interpret and respond to user prompts. System
      prompts ensure that the generated outputs align with the intended goals.
    </para>

    <title>How does a system prompt work?</title>
    <para>
      System prompts serve as a map that guides the AI model through the
      complexities of natural language understanding and generation. Describing
      the task, the desired output format, and setting limits to the AI's
      behavior helps AI models generate accurate and relevant responses.
    </para>
    <para>
      System prompts are processed before the user input. This placement ensures
      that the AI has access to the necessary context, instructions and
      guidelines before processing the user's prompt.
    </para>
    <section xml:id="content-of-system-prompt">
      <title>Content of a system prompt</title>
      <para>
        A typical system prompt contains the following elements:
      </para>
      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>Context</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              This part sets the scene or provides necessary information for the
              AI to understand the situation.
            </para>
            <para>
              Example: <quote>You are a travel agent recommending vacation
              destinations.</quote>
            </para>

          <listitem>
            <para>
              A clear instruction on what the AI should do. This is the core of
              the system prompt, directing the AI to perform a specific task.
            </para>
            <para>
              Example: <quote>Generate text summaries and annual
              reports.</quote>

          <listitem>
            <para>
              These are rules that the AI must follow. They might limit the
              output format, length, tone or other criteria.
            </para>
            <para>
              Example: <quote>The recommendations should be less than 150 words
              each, and they should appeal to adventure travelers.</quote>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>Format</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              If you want the response in a particular structure, the system
              prompt should mention that. It can be a list, paragraph, dialogue
              or code block.
            </para>
            <para>
              Example: <quote>Respond in a bullet point list.</quote>

            <para>
              You can instruct the AI to generate responses with a particular
              tone, such as formal, casual, humorous or technical.
            </para>

        <para>
          The resulting prompt that corresponds to the above guidelines may look
          similar to the following example. You can copy and paste the whole
          text into an AI-driven chatbot prompt.
        </para>
<screen>Direction:

Adopt a professional and informative tone throughout the report. The
content should be clear, concise, and tailored to a business audience.

Format:

The output should be in the form of a formal report, structured with headings,
subheadings, and bullet points where necessary. Use professional language
and adhere to business writing standards.

Examples:

Here is a template of the report structure to follow:

Executive Summary:
- Overview of key findings and recommendations.
Detailed Findings:
- Section 1: [Topic]
- Section 2: [Topic]
- Section 3: [Topic]
Conclusions:
- Summary of findings and next steps.

Please refer to previous reports such as [Report A] and [Report B] for style
and formatting guidelines.

Quality:

Use the following checklist to ensure the report's accuracy and relevance:
1. Verify all data and statistics are correct and up-to-date.
2. Ensure the report is free of grammatical and typographical errors.
3. Cross-check that all sections are consistent and logically structured.
4. Validate that the report meets the customerâ€™s objectives and addresses
   their concerns.

Labor:

Divide the report into the following sections:
1. Executive Summary: Summarize the main findings and key recommendations in a 
   concise manner.
2. Detailed Findings: Provide in-depth analysis and data for each key area of
   focus, divided into logical subsections.
3. Conclusions: Offer a summary of the findings and suggest actionable next
   steps for the customer.</screen>

    <para>
      System prompts enhance the performance and user experience of AI models.
      By providing clear instructions, context and guidelines, system prompts
      enable AI models to generate more accurate and relevant responses. The
      following use cases include example system prompts.

            When AI models must act as a specific persona, for example, a
            virtual assistant or a teacher, maintaining the persona is important
            for consistent user experience.

            In certain cases, users may (intentionally) ask questions that are
            outside the scope of the AI's persona. and knowledge. Without proper
            guidance, the AI model may generate responses that are inconsistent
            and inappropriate.

            <para>
              If a user asks about topics outside your expertise, such as
              medical advice or legal matters, inform them that you are not
              qualified to provide relevant responses. Suggest that they should

              When generating stories or poems, use figurative language with
              metaphors, similes and personification, to make your writing more
              vivid and engaging. Use a wide range of literary techniques, such
              as symbolism and irony, to create depth and layers of meaning.
