    &productname; comes along with <productname>&gnome;
    Desktop</productname>, a desktop environment with an easy-to-use graphical
    interface. This article describes the default configuration of
    <productname>&gnome; Desktop</productname>. If you or your system
    administrator modify the defaults, certain aspects might be different, such
    as appearance or key combinations.

  <title>What is <productname>&gnome; Desktop</productname>?</title>
  <para>
   <productname>&gnome; Desktop</productname> is a graphical environment for
   everything you see on the screen, like the login and home screen. It also
   offers several applications you need for your daily tasks like mail client,
   calendar, file browser, and many more.
  </para>
  <para>
    Certain versions of &productname; ship with as many as four
   different session configurations based on &gnome;. These are:
  </para>
  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>&gnome; (default)</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A <productname>&gnome; 4</productname> configuration that is
      close to the upstream design. It focuses on interrupting users as little
      as possible. However, starting applications and switching between them
      works differently from many other desktop operating systems. It uses a
      single panel at the top of the screen. <phrase os="osuse">The
      session is started on <productname>Wayland</productname>.
      </phrase>
     </para>

      Classic on Xorg</productname>
    </term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      <productname>&gnome; classic</productname> is for users who prefer a
      more traditional desktop experience. It is based on
      <productname>&gnome; 4</productname> technologies but provides a
      number of changes to the user interface. <productname>&gnome; Classic on
      Xorg</productname> starts on <productname>Xorg</productname>.
      </para>

   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry os="osuse">

     <para>
      By default &productname; uses &gnome; with

    <listitem>
     <para>
      A basic desktop designed to use little resources. It can act as
      a fallback if other options are unavailable or slow.

  </variablelist>
  <para>
   The version described here is the default configuration of
   &productname;, which is &gnome;. The main difference between the
   configurations is the look and feel of the home screen and the main
   menu. Most of what is described in the following applies to all four
   configurations.

    <title>
      <productname>Wayland</productname> vs. <productname>Xorg</productname>
    </title>
    <para>
      Both are full-featured, open source implementations of the
      <productname>X Window System</productname>, which provides the
      foundational graphical interface for Unix-like operating systems,
      including Linux.
      <productname>Xorg</productname> is a mature, highly compatible, but
      complex solution. Whereas <productname>Wayland</productname> is newer,
      using a simpler architecture, but it does not yet offer the wide range
      of compatibility and maturity as <productname>Xorg</productname>. Both
      protocols have their strengths and weaknesses. The choice between them
      depends on specific needs, including hardware compatibility, performance
      requirements, and the specific applications being used.
