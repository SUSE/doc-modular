  <para>
   <productname>&gnome; Desktop</productname> is a graphical environment for
   everything you see on the screen, like the login and home screen. It also
   offers several applications you need for your daily tasks like mail client,

    <term>&gnome; (default)</term>
    <listitem>
     <para> A <productname>&gnome; 4</productname> configuration that is
      close to the upstream design. It focuses on interrupting users as little
      as possible. However, starting applications and switching between them
      works differently from many other desktop operating systems. It uses a
      single panel at the top of the screen. <phrase os="osuse;sled">This
