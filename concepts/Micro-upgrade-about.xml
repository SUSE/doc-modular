    &suse; supports upgrades between two releases of &productname;. Whether it
    is better to upgrade or perform a fresh installation depends on your
    specific scenario. While upgrades involve less work, fresh installations
    ensure you benefit from all the new features of a release, such as disk
    layout changes, specific filesystem features, and other improvements. To
    get the most out of your system, &suse; therefore recommends fresh
    installations in most scenarios.
