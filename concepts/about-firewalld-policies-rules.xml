    <title>About &firewalld; policies and rules</title>

    <abstract>
      <para>
      &firewalld; policies provide a more advanced and flexible way to manage network traffic compared to traditional zones.
      They allow you to define rich rules that specify the source and destination of traffic, services, ports and actions such as accept, reject and drop.
      These policies are useful for setting up complex routing, port forwarding or creating isolated network segments within a single host.

    <para>
    &firewalld; policies leverage zones to define rule sets. They apply rules state fully and uni-directionally, which means you define traffic flow in one direction,
    and &firewalld; implicitly permits the return path. These policies link an ingress zone (where traffic enters) with an egress zone (where traffic exits).
    This defines the specific path and direction a policy's rules apply to. You can view the policies, for example:
  </para>
  <screen>&prompt.user; /usr/lib/firewalld/policies ls
    allow-host-ipv6.xml
  </screen>
<para>Firewall rules let you precisely control network traffic, allowing or blocking it to protect your system from security threats.
 Firewall rules define certain criteria based on various attributes such as, source and destination IP addresses, ports, network interfaces etc.
&firewalld; segregates firewall rules into zones and policies. Each zone in &firewalld; has a unique set of rules that dictates the traffic permissions for its associated network interfaces.
