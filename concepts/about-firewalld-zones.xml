    <title>About &firewalld; zones</title>
    <meta name="maintainer" content="amrita.sakthivel@suse.com" its:translate="no"/>
    <abstract>
      <para>
     A firewall zone is a predefined set of rules that dictate how incoming and outgoing network traffic is handled for a specific network interface or source IP address.
     Each zone represents a different level of trust for the network it's associated with. You can apply different security policies based on where the network connection originates.

    <para>
     Zones are like security profiles. For example, you would want to apply different firewall rules for a public Wi-Fi connection and your secure home network.
     &firewalld; zones allow you to define these distinct sets of rules and apply them accordingly.
     A network connection is subject to the rules of only one &firewalld; zone. A &firewalld; zone can have many network interfaces or source IP addresses.
      </para>
      <para>The <filename>/usr/lib/firewalld/zones/ </filename> directory stores the predefined zones. For example:</para>
      <screen>&prompt.user; /usr/lib/firewalld/zones ls
      block.xml  dmz.xml  docker.xml  drop.xml  external.xml  home.xml  internal.xml  nm-shared.xml  public.xml  trusted.xml  work.xml
      </screen>
      <para>The default settings of the predefined zones are as follows:</para>

                <para>
                  <emphasis>Behavior:</emphasis> All incoming network packets are dropped without any reply. Only outgoing connections initiated from the system are allowed.
                  This provides a "stealth" mode where the system appears non-existent to external attackers.
