    <title>About the FQDN</title>
    <meta name="maintainer" content="amrita.sakthivel@suse.com" its:translate="no"/>
    <abstract>
      <para>
FQDN stands for Fully Qualified Domain Name. A FQDN is a domain name that specifies its exact location in the tree hierarchy of the DNS (Domain Name System).
It is absolute which means it provides every label from the specific host up to the DNS root zone.

  </info>
<para>An FQDN consists of two main parts; the hostname and the domain name. It is structured from the most specific label,on the left, to the most general which in on the right.</para>
<para>For example, <literal>mail.google.com.</literal>:</para>
<itemizedlist>
 <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Hostname:</emphasis><literal>mail</literal>identifies a specific server or service, in this case, it is the server handling email.</para></listitem>
 <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Subdomain:</emphasis><literal>google</literal>is the specific organization or network.</para></listitem>
 <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Top-Level Domain:</emphasis><literal>com</literal>is the general category (commercial).</para></listitem>
 <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Trailing Dot:</emphasis><literal>.</literal>is the root zone. While we usually leave it off when typing in a browser, a true FQDN technically ends with a dot. This signals that the name is absolute and not relative to another domain.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>A hostname and FQDN are distinctly different because they serve different functions in a networked environment.
A hostname is a simple human readable label assigned to a device on a local network. It is relative because it only identifies the machine within its immediate sub-network.
A FQDN is the absolute and unambiguous address of that host on the internet. It combines the hostname with the full domain hierarchy.
