    &ad;* (&ada;) is a directory-service based on LDAP, Kerberos, and
    other services. It is used by Microsoft&thrdmrk; Windows&thrdmrk; to manage
    resources, services, and people. In a Microsoft Windows network, &ad; provides
    information about these objects, restricts access to them, and enforces
    policies.
    &productname; lets you join existing &ad; domains and integrate your
    Linux machine into a Windows environment.
   </para>
   <para>
    &productname; offers you the following benefits when integrated with &ad;
  </para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
<term>Offline authentication</term>
<listitem>
  <para>
    Users can log in and access their local data on the Linux
    machine even if they are offline or the &ad; server is unavailable for
    other reasons.

<term>Windows password change</term>
<listitem>
  <para>
    This port of &ad; support in Linux enforces corporate password policies
      stored in &ad;. The console support
      password change messages and accept your input. You can even use the
      Linux <command>passwd</command> command to set Windows passwords.

        <para>
          <command>adcli</command> can transparently

    To communicate with the directory service, the client needs to share at
    least two protocols with the server:
   </para>
   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>LDAP</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       LDAP is a protocol optimized for managing directory information. A
       Windows domain controller with &ad; can use the LDAP protocol to
       exchange directory information with the clients.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>Kerberos</term>
     <listitem>
      <para> Kerberos is a third-party trusted authentication service.
             All its clients trust Kerberos authorization of another
             client's identity, enabling kerberized single-sign-on (SSO)
             solutions. Windows supports a Kerberos implementation,
             making Kerberos SSO possible even with Linux clients. </para>
