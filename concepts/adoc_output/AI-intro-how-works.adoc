&productname; architecture

&productname; is a cloud native solution that comprises multiple
software building blocks. These blocks include the Linux operating
system, &kube; cluster with a Web UI management layer, supportive tools
to utilize GPU capabilities, and other containerized applications that
care for monitoring and security. The &sappco; includes a collection of
AI-related applications called &ailibrary;.

&productname; building blocks

Linux operating system

The underlying operating system with the optional &nvidia; driver
installed. We prefer &sls; (). If you require an immutable operating
system, &slema; is the recommended alternative.

&kube; cluster

&kube; cluster managed by &ranchermanager; ensuring container and
application lifecycle management. We recommend using the &rke2; ()
distribution.

&nvoperator;

Utilizes the &nvidia; GPU computing power and capabilities for
processing AI-related tasks.

&ssecurity; ()

For security and compliance.

&sobservability; ()

Provides advanced performance and data monitoring.

&sstorage; ()

Enterprise-grade storage solution.

&svirtualization; ()

For virtualized workloads.

&smlm; ()

For managing multiple Linux distributions.

&sappco; ()

As a source of &helm; charts and container images for the &ailibrary;
applications.

&ailibrary; applications

Following is a list of AI applications that you can find in the
&sappco;. For a complete and up-to-date list, refer to .

&certmanager; ()

An extensible X.509 certificate controller for &kube; workloads.

&opensearch; ()

A search and analytics suite for analyzing and visualizing search data.

&milvus; ()

A vector database built for generative AI applications with minimal
performance loss.

&ollama; ()

A platform that simplifies the installation and management of large
language models (LLM) on local devices.

&owui; ()

An extensible Web user interface for the &ollama; LLM runner.

&vllm; (

A high-performance inference and serving engine for large language
models (LLMs).

&mcpo; ()

The &mcp;-to-OpenAPI proxy server provided by &owui;.

&pytorch; ()

An open source machine learning framework.

&mlflow; ()

An open source platform to manage the machine learning lifecycle,
including experimentation, reproducibility, deployment and a central
model registry.
