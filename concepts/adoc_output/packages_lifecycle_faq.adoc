Package maintainer's FAQ

The topic covers FAQ a package mantaine may have.

I want to define a lifecycle for my package. What should I do?

Raise a Jira ticket so we can track and document the process. If you are
not sure about the lifecycle category, contact your manager and a SLEA
architect.

Which type of lifecycle can or should I adopt?

The further down in the stack your component is, the more packages
depend on it, so you should take a more conservative approach. When in
doubt, contact the SLEA architects.

I want to use a balanced lifecycle for my package. Should I go for
several versions in parallel?

In general, it is better to replace the old package with a new version.
It creates less overhead on the maintainer side and is less confusing to
customers. A sliding window is useful for most toolchain components that
have API or ABI changes as part of new releases. However, the particular
approach depends on the amount and type of changes. For example, if the
changes can be adopted easily or even automated, then it is better to
just update the package. When changes lead to conflicts that neither we
nor the customer can easily resolve, then maintaining parallel versions
is a better option.

SUSE tried this on a case-by-case basis for Python modules.

Should I convert my package from a balanced lifecycle to an agile one,
and release updated versions also to code streams under LTS?

This is a question that we need to investigate in every case. In
general, if the particular package is beneficial for customers on the
older releases, then it may be worth releasing the updated packages to
older releases. For example, if a component is mostly about operations,
then it may be useful for customers on older releases. On the contrary,
newer packages that provide hardware enablement are usually not needed,
as customers' hardware has not changed since the time of installation.
