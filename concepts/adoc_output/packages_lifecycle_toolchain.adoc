Python interpreter and stack support lifecycles

The support lifecycles of the Python interpreter are the following:

Short-term support interpreter

It is supported for 2 years. The support lifecycle applies also to basic
packages: setuptools, venv, pip, wheel and pipx.

Primary Python

The OS's main Python. It is supported for 4 years and includes the
interpreter and its stack, /usr/bin/python3 and all packages with the
python3- prefix.

Legacy Python

It is supported for 4 years and includes the interpreter and stack but
not the python3- packages. A legacy interpreter is a former primary
Python. Short-term interpreters, by contrast, follow a different
lifecycle and are becoming legacy.

Python release cycle

The starting version of Python in &suselinux; 16 is Python 3.13. &suse;
plans to release every odd version of Python and provide the LTS for up
to 8 years.

The latest Python interpreter is delivered with each minor release with
only short-term support. The outdated Python version is migrated to the
legacy mode and is supported for another 4 years.

The following table shows probable versions of Python to be delivered
with particular &suselinux; versions. The exact version will depend on
the upstream community.
