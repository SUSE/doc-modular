    <abstract>
      <para>
        Ansible is an open-source IT automation engine that automates provisioning, configuration management, application deployment and other IT processes.
        It is simple and has agent less architecture, which means it does not require any special software installed on the machines it manages.
      It operates on the following concepts: </para>

  <emphasis role="bold">Ansible Core</emphasis> is the foundational software package that includes command-line tools like <literal>ansible</literal> and <literal>ansible-playbook</literal> and the execution engine.
  It provides the essential libraries and basic modules needed to connect to managed nodes and execute tasks.
  <emphasis role="bold">Ansible automation components</emphasis> are the content that defines the logic, packaged into playbooks, roles, and collections.
  These assets provide the instructions for the Core engine, with collections serving as a distribution format that bundles reusable roles, modules and plugins.
  <emphasis role="bold">Ansible Orchestration</emphasis> is handled by higher-level tools that provide a UI, API and workflow engine to centrally manage and visually chain multiple automation playbooks together for complex multi-system processes.
