  <title> certificate role variables</title>
  <para>Instead of a single and a standardized set of variables, the role uses several distinct variable groups to handle different aspects of certificate management. </para>
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
<literal>certificate_requests</literal>: is the most important variable group. It is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary defines the details for a single certificate you want to create or manage.
This is where you specify the domain, subject alternative names, key size, and other core certificate details.
The default is <literal>[]</literal>.
</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
 <literal>certificate_wait</literal>: controls whether an Ansible task should pause and wait for a certificate to be successfully issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) before proceeding.
  The default value is <literal>true</literal>, which means that that subsequent tasks in your playbook like configuring a web server does not run until the certificate is available, preventing errors caused by missing files.
</para>
  </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   <example><title>A certificate playbook example </title>
    <para> This playbook assumes a certificate and private key already exist on the target machine and are located in a standard directory.
       It sets the file owner to <literal>root</literal> and the group to a specific user <literal>nginx</literal>, to allow the web server to read the
       certificate while keeping the private key secure.
