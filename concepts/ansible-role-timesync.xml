  <para> This roles manages time synchronization on a Linux host. It automates the installation and configuration of a time service
    such as, &chronyd; or &ntp; to ensure the system clock is accurately synchronized with a network time source.
   Supported &ntp; or &ptp; implementations are &chrony;, &ntp; (the reference implementation) and <literal>linuxptp</literal>.
    </para>
    <important>
      <para>The <literal>timesync</literal>role overwrites the configuration of the time synchronization service on the managed host.
        All previous settings will be replaced and are not preserved, even if they are explicitly defined in the role's variables.</para>

        # for the chrony.conf file, by providing a list of settings. As an example,
        # for debugging, one might need to log mesurements, statistics and tracking.
        # This information is usually stored in the /var/log/chrony directory. For
        # that, one needs to define two different settings (logdir and log), as
        # follows:

        # to `false`, the role will notify the user that a reboot is required, allowing
        # for custom handling of the reboot requirement. If this variable is not set,
        # the role will fail to ensure the reboot requirement is not overlooked.
        # For non-transactional update systems, this variable is ignored.
