       The topic describes who is able to login to &cockpit; and switching to elevated privileges tasks.
      </para>
    </abstract>
  </info>
  <para>
    You do not need separate credentials to log in to &cockpit;. Use
    the same credentials that you use to log in to &productname;. However, 
    on new installations login using &rootuser; is not allowed by default. Either you can enable
  login &rootuser; with a password as described in <xref linkend=""/>, or you create a non-privileged user to access &cockpit;. On instances upgraded from a previous release, &rootuser; login is still allowed.
   In all cases, we recommend to enhance the security by adding 2FA as described in <xref linkend=""/>.
  </para>
  <para>
    Non-privileged users log in to &cockpit; with limited access. To perform
    administrative tasks, click <guimenu>Limited access</guimenu> in the 
    top-right menu and unlock the administrative mode by entering 
    &rootuser; password.
