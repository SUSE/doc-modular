  <para>
    You do not need separate credentials to log in to &cockpit;. Use
    the same credentials that you use to log in to &productname;. However, 
    on new installations, login using &rootuser; is not allowed by default. Either enable
  &rootuser; login with a password as described in <xref linkend="cockpit-allow-root-login"/>, or 
  create an unprivileged user to access &cockpit;. On instances upgraded from a previous 
  release, &rootuser; login is still allowed.
   In all cases, we recommend enhancing the security by adding 2FA as described in <xref linkend="cockpit-adding-2fa"/>.

  <para>
    At first, you log in to &cockpit; with limited access. To perform
    administrative tasks, click <guimenu>Limited access</guimenu> in the 
    upper-right menu and unlock the administrative mode by entering 
    your password.
