    A bond interface is a combination of several network interfaces into one
    bond. Depending on the <guimenu>Mode</guimenu> (described further), network
    bonding can improve performance by increasing the network throughput and
    bandwidth. Network bonding can also increase fault tolerance by keeping
    overall connectivity even if some of the bonded interfaces stopped working.
