      is a provisioning tool that enables you to configure a system according
      to your specification on the first boot.

    <title>How does &ignition; work?</title>
    <para>
      When the system is booted for the first time, &ignition; is loaded as
      part of an <filename>initramfs</filename> and searches for a
      configuration file within a specific directory (on a USB flash disk, or
      you can provide a URL). All changes are performed before the kernel
      switches from the temporary file system to the real root file system
      (before the <literal>switch_root</literal> command is issued).
    </para>
    <para>
      &ignition; uses a configuration file in the JSON format named
      <filename>config.ign</filename>. You can either write the configuration
      manually or use the &fuelignition; Web application at
      <link
      xlink:href="&fuelignition-dld-site;"/> to generate it.
    </para>
    <important>
      <para>
        &fuelignition; does not cover the complete &ignition;
        vocabulary yet, and the resulting JSON file may need additional manual
        tweaking.
      </para>
    </important>
    <tip>
      <para>
        If you decide to write the &ignition; configuration manually and prefer
        the YAML format over JSON, you can create a YAML file and convert this
        file to JSON using a <literal>Butane</literal> tool. For details, refer
        to <xref linkend="deployment-convert-yaml-to-json"/>.
      </para>
    </tip>
    <section xml:id="deployment-ignition-config-file">
      <title><filename>config.ign</filename></title>
      <para>
        When installing on bare metal, the configuration file
        <filename>config.ign</filename> must reside in the
        <filename>ignition</filename> subdirectory on the configuration media,
        for example, a USB stick labeled <literal>ignition</literal>. The
        directory structure must look as follows:
      </para>
<screen>
&lt;root directory&gt;
└── ignition
    └── config.ign

 </screen>
      <tip>
        <para>
          To create a disk image with the &ignition; configuration, you can use
          the &fuelignition; Web application at &fuelignition-dld-site;.
        </para>
      </tip>
      <para>
        If you intend to configure a virtual machine with &vmm; (&libvirt;),
        provide the path to the <filename>config.ign</filename> file in its XML
        definition, for example:
      </para>
<screen>
&lt;domain ... >
  &lt;sysinfo type="fwcfg">
    &lt;entry name="opt/com.coreos/config" file="/location/to/config.ign"/>
  &lt;/sysinfo>
&lt;/domain>
</screen>
      <para>
        The <filename>config.ign</filename> contains various data types:
        objects, strings, integers, booleans and lists of objects. For a
        complete specification, refer to
        <link xlink:href="https://coreos.github.io/ignition/configuration-v3_3/">&ignition;
        specification v3.3.0</link>.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <literal>version</literal> attribute is mandatory and in case of
        &productnameshort;, its value must be set either to
        <literal>3.3.0</literal> or to any lower version. Otherwise, &ignition;
        will fail.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you want to log in to your system as &rootuser;, you must at least
        include a password for &rootuser;. However, it is recommended to
        establish access via SSH keys. To configure a password, make sure to
        use a secure one. If you use a randomly generated password, use at
        least 10 characters. If you create your password manually, use even
        more than 10 characters and combine uppercase and lowercase letters and
        numbers.
