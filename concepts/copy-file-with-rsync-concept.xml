        You can use the <literal>rsync</literal> tool for transferring or copying files locally and remotely. <literal>rsync</literal> is unidirectional. It copies files in a single direction and does not synchronize data. 
Instead of transmitting all the contents in the file, <literal>rsync</literal> minimizes the amount of data copied by moving only the changes within the file. Hence, this supports the transfer of data over a slow network connection.</para>

  </info>
  <para>For copying large files using <literal>rsync</literal>, detecting changes requires certain computing power. So ensure that machines on both source and destination have enough resources, including RAM. </para>
<para>Use rsync when a large amount of data containing only minor changes needs to be transmitted regularly. This is useful when working with backups. <literal>rsync</literal> can also be useful for mirroring staging servers that store complete directory trees of Web servers to a Web server in a DMZ.</para>
<para>This article includes examples that show the usage of <literal>rsync</literal> to copy files locally and remotely. This document also explains how to configure and use an <literal>rsync</literal> server.</para>
