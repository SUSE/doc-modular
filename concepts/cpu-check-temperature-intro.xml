      Checking and monitoring CPU temperature has several benefits.

      <listitem>
       <para>Energy savings and cost reduction. When a CPU runs at full
        speed, it consumes more energy than when it is idling. Also, running
        CPUs cool is a critical cost factor, especially in data centers.

       <para>
        Identifying and monitoring processes that consume too much CPU power.
        Doing that can help to free your CPU resources and increase the CPU's responsiveness.

      <listitem>
       <para>Easier detection of cooling issues. If the CPU temperature reaches 80Â°C or
        higher, it indicates that there is a problem with the cooling system or the fan,
        or that the thermal paste was not applied correctly.

       <para>
        A long-term reduction of the carbon footprint can be achieved by adjusting the cooling parameters.
