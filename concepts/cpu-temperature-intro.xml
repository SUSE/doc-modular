      Checking and monitoring CPU temperature has several benefits.

      <listitem>
       <para>Energy savings and cost reduction. When a CPU runs at full
        speed, it consumes more energy than when it is idling. Also, running
        CPUs cool is a critical cost factor, especially in data centers.

      <listitem>
       <para>
        Identifying processes that consume too much CPU power. Doing that can help to free your CPU resources and increase the CPU's responsiveness.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>Easier detection of cooling issues. If the CPU temperature reaches 80°C or higher, it indicates that there is a problem with the cooling system or the fan, or that the thermal paste was not applied correctly.

      <listitem>
       <para>
        A long-term reduction of the carbon footprint can be achieved by adjusting the cooling parameters.
