    This article explains how to transform the provided raw OS image into a purpose-built system. The
    process may involve installing the necessary software from RPMs and applying custom configurations
    for standard deployments. For specialized hardware not supported by the default image, we will
    also cover how to build and integrate custom kernel modules and drivers to ensure full system
    functionality.
