      <para>
        Pre-built images are ready-to-use representations of a running
        operating system. They are not installed in a traditional way using an
        installer, but copied to the hard disk of the target host. The topic
        covers basic information about these pre-built images.

  <para>
    The pre-built images are intended to be configured on the first boot by
    using tools delivered in the images. The boot loader detects the first boot
    as described in <xref linkend="deployment-first-boot-detection"/>.
