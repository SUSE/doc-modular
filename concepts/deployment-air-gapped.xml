    <abstract>
      <para>
        An air-gapped environment is a security measure where a single host or
        the whole network is isolated from all other networks, such as the
        public Internet. This <quote>air gap</quote> acts as a physical or
        logical barrier, preventing any direct connection that could be
        exploited by cyber threats.

    <title>Why air-gapped environment is important?</title>
    <para>
      The primary goal is to protect highly sensitive data and critical systems
      from unauthorized access, cyber attacks, malware and ransomware.
      Air-gapped environments are typically found in situations where security
      is of the utmost importance, such as:

    <title>How do air-gapped environments work?</title>
    <para>
      There are two types of air gaps:
    </para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Physical air gaps</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            This is the most secure method, where the system is disconnected
            from any network. It might even involve placing the system in a
            shielded room.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Logical air gaps</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            This type uses software controls such as firewall rules and network
            segmentation to create a highly restricted connection. While it
            offers more convenience, it is not as secure as a physical air gap
            because the air-gapped system is still technically connected to a
            network.

    <title>What challenges do air-gapped environments face?</title>
    <para>
      When working in air-gapped systems, you usually face the following
      limitations:
    </para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Manual updates</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Air-gapped systems cannot automatically receive software or security
            updates from external networks. You must manually download and
            install updates, which can be time-consuming and create
            vulnerabilities if not done regularly.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Insider threats and physical attacks</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            An air gap does not protect against threats that gain physical
            access to the system, such as a malicious insider with a compromised
            USB drive.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Limited functionality</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The lack of connectivity limits the system's ability to communicate
            with other devices or services, making it less efficient for many
            modern applications.
          </para>
