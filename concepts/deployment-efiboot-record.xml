     During the deployment, the image of the system is
     just copied to the selected disk. Therefore, an EFI boot entry is not
     created. You may need to manually boot your system using the EFI
     shell by selecting the &productname; boot loader. After the first boot, you can
     use <command>efibootmgr</command> to create the boot entry.
     <command>efibootmgr</command> is available by default in the deployed
     image.
