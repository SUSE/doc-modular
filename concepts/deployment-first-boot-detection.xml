      <para>
        When deploying the raw or selfinstall images, the system must
        distinquish the first boot from subsequent boots. This topic covers how
        is this action performed.
      </para>

  <para>
    The deployment configuration runs on the first boot only. To distinguish
    between the first and subsequent boots, the file
    <filename>/etc/machine-id</filename> is created after the
    first boot finishes. If the file is not present in the file system, the system assumes that
    this is a first boot and triggers the configuration process. After completing the first boot, the
    <filename>/etc/machine-id</filename> file is
    created.
  </para>
  <note>
    <title>The <filename>/etc/machine-id</filename> file is always created</title>
    <para>
      Even though the configuration may not be successful because of improper
      or missing configuration files, the
      <filename>/etc/machine-id</filename> file is
      created.

    <title>Force system reconfiguration on a subsequent boot</title>
    <para>
      If you need to reconfigure your system after the first boot happened, you
      can force the reconfiguration on the subsequent boot. Here you have two
      options.
