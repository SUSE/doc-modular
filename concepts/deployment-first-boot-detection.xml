      <para>
       When deploying the raw or selfinstall images, the system must distinquish the first boot
       from subsequent boots. This topic covers how is this action performed.
      </para>
    </abstract>
  </info>
        <para>
        The deployment configuration runs on the first boot only. To
        distinguish between the first and subsequent boots, the flag file
        <filename>/boot/writable/firstboot_happened</filename> is created after
        the first boot finishes. If the file is not present in the file system,
        the attribute <literal>ignition.firstboot</literal> is passed to the
        kernel command line and thus both &ignition; and &combustion; are
        triggered to run (in the initrd). After completing the first boot, the
        <filename>/boot/writable/firstboot_happened</filename> flag file is
        created.
      </para>
      <note>
        <title>The flag file is always created</title>
        <para>
          Even though the configuration may not be successful because of improper
          or missing configuration files, the
          <filename>/boot/writable/firstboot_happened</filename> flag file is
          created.

          If you need to reconfigure your system after the first boot happened, you can force the
          reconfiguration on the subsequent boot. Here you have two options.
