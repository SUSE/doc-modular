  <command>su</command>. Both let you execute commands as &rootuser;.

      <para>
        &sudo; allows you to run a command as &rootuser;. Depending on the
        configuration, it does not require you to enter the &rootuser; password,
        but only the user's password. This way, no sensitive information needs
        to be shared with all the other (regular) users.
      </para>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        With the &sudo; configuration file, the system administrator can control
        which users are allowed to use &sudo; and restrict the usage to certain
        tasks.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        &sudo; caches the password for a certain period of time. After this
        period, you are prompted for the password again, when running another
        &sudo; command.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
        <para>
    All commands executed with &sudo; are logged individually. The log file
    tracks date and time, the user that ran the command, and the command itself.

      It cannot be configured to restrict access to certain users and tasks and
      elevate the privileges for anyone who knows the &rootuser; password.

    <para>
    The privileges are elevated for the entire terminal session. As long as you
    stay in the session, you are not prompted for the password again.
   </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
      Commands executed with <command>su</command> are not logged individually,
      as all actions can only be logged with the &rootuser; user account.
