            <para>
            You can execute single commands as a &rootuser; or another user, based on your settings in the <filename>/etc/sudoers</filename> file.
            The sudoers files are files that Linux administrators use to allocate system rights to the system users.
            This allows the administrator to control who does what.
            If you want to securely execute a command as a &rootuser; user, you must always use the &sudo; command.

        <example>
    <title><command>su</command> example</title>
     <screen>su
Password:</screen>
     <para>When you use the <command>su</command> command, you will be prompted to enter the password for the user currently in use.
     You can also specify the user with the <command>su</command> command.</para>

           </example>
           <example><title>Specify the user name with <command>su</command></title>
           <screen>su USERNAME</screen>
           <para>You can also specify the user name. </para>
           </example>
           <example>
           <title>&sudo; example</title>
     <screen>&prompt.sudo;su - </screen>
       <para>You are switching to root, and you need the root password. &sudo; is the safest way to elevate privileges.
       With the &sudo; command, you must prefix &sudo; before every command.
       This means that you do not need to remember to switch back to regular user mode, which is the case when you use the <command>su</command>.
