  To log in as &rootuser; you can preface your command with one of the
  following options:
</para>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    <command>su</command>: allows you to run a command as &rootuser; but
    requires you to know the &rootuser; password.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    &sudo;: allows you to run a command as &rootuser; and, depending on it's
    configuration, it may not require the &rootuser; password.
  </para>
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
 <para>
  You can execute single commands as &rootuser; or another user, based
  on your settings in the <filename>/etc/sudoers</filename> file. The
  <filename>sudoers</filename> files are files that Linux administrators use to
  allocate system rights to the system users. This allows the administrator to
  control who does what. If you want to securely execute a command as a
  &rootuser; user, you must always use the &sudo; command. The main
  difference between &sudo; and <command>su</command> commands is that
  <command>su</command> elevates privileges only during the shell session while
  &sudo; elevates privileges only for the specific command that you execute.
