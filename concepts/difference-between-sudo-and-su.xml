            You can execute single commands as a &rootuser; or another user, based on your settings in the <filename>/etc/sudoers</filename> file.
            The sudoers files are files that Linux administrators use to allocate system rights to the system users.
            This allows the administrator to control who does what.
            If you want to execute a command as a &rootuser; user, you must always use the sudo command:

     <screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper install nginx</screen>
       <para>The <command>su</command> command allows you to switch the user and to do that you need the password for the user you are switching to.
         Often, the switch is to the root user though it can be any other user on the system. </para>

           <title>Example 2</title>
     <screen>&prompt.sudo;su - </screen>
       <para>You are switching to root, and you need the root password. &sudo; is the safest way to elevate privileges.
       With the &sudo; command, you must prefix &sudo; before every command.
       This means that you do not need to remember to switch back to regular user mode, which is the case when you use the <command>su</command>.
