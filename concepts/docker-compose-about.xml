    <title>How does Compose work?</title>
    <para>
      First, you need to create a YAML file that define your application. In the file, you need to
      define the following components:  
    </para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Service</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            A service is a computing component of the application. It is a run of a container image
            with a partiular configuration.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Network</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Networks define IP routes between services.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Volume</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            A directory where services store and shares data.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>
      You may also need to use a list of environment variables that will be passed to your services.
    </para>
    <para>
      After you create the YAML file, you can manage your compose application using the compose CLI.
