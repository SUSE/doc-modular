>&#13;          In general, it is better to replace the old package with a new version. It creates less
          overhead on the maintainer side and is less confusing to customers. A sliding window
          is useful for most toolchain components that have API or ABI changes as part of
          new releases. However, the particular approach depends on the amount and type of changes.
          For example, if the changes can be adopted easily or even automated, then it is better to
          just update the package. When changes lead to conflicts that neither we nor the customer can easily resolve, then maintaining parallel versions is a better option.

>&#13;          This is a question that we need to investigate in every case. In general, if
          the particular package is beneficial for customers on the older releases, then it may be
          worth releasing the updated packages to older releases. For example, if a component is
          mostly about operations, then it may be useful for customers on older releases. On
          the contrary, newer packages that provide hardware enablement are usually not needed, as
          customers' hardware has not changed since the time of installation.
