  <P
>&#13;    When categorizing a package, the impact of its changes on the system is considered. To estimate this impact, the interfaces of the component must first be identified. For example, in the case of a shared library, changes to its API or ABI may disrupt the system. For a compiler or interpreter, disruptive changes may involve supported languages, command-line options, or the performance of the compiled code. By contrast, a minor backward compatible change may have little to no impact.

<P

CLASS="bold"
><B
CLASS="emphasis"
>balanced</B
></SPAN
>, or <SPAN
CLASS="bold"
><B
CLASS="emphasis"
>agile</B

  packages sorted into several categories, for example, Python. The following sections
  describe the package categories in detail.

    <P
>&#13;      Packages that are marked as stable* (also called conservative) are those that do not deliver a disruptive change
      while a customer is on any of the 16 minor versions. During the upgrade to another minor
      version, the package version may change but the newer version does <SPAN

      at the cost of bringing disruptive changes. Alternatively, if a new version of a package
      contains disruptive changes, this version can be delivered as an alternative to the previous one.

    <P
>&#13;      Packages categorized as balanced are changing (driven by upstream evolution and customer demands), but should not cause disruptive changes
      within one minor version. A few incompatible changes are possible, but always
      documented in the release notes for that particular minor release.
    </P

    <P

      However, the transition must be smooth, either by getting back to the original behavior or by
      providing the older version in parallel with the new one.

minor release.

      </LI

    <P

    </P

    <P
>&#13;      To help with incorporating changes in a conservative environment, the tick-tock model can be
      used. For example, we could mark even-numbered minor releases as <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>tick</I
></SPAN

      releases and odd-numbered minor releases as <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I

>tock</I
></SPAN

CLASS="emphasis"
><I

    <P
>&#13;      For ISVs, a stable runtime environment is critical. Therefore, not to break third-party
      applications, in the case of shared libraries where SUSE provides the corresponding
      <TT
CLASS="literal"
>-devel</TT
> package, the older <TT
CLASS="literal"
>.so</TT
> version is not deprecated
      immediately. For example, for a package called <TT
CLASS="literal"
>foo</TT
>, there are packages:
      <TT
CLASS="literal"
>libfoo-0_1</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="literal"
>foo-devel</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="literal"
>foo-utils</TT
>. 
      If the package is updated and the shared library version changes to 
      <TT
CLASS="literal"
>libfoo-0_2</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="literal"
>libfoo-0_1</TT
> is not removed.
