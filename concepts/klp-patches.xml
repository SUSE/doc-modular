    <title>Understanding kernel live patches</title>

  <para>
    Kernel live patches are delivered as packages with modified code that are
    separate from the main kernel package. The live patches are cumulative, so
    the latest patch contains all fixes from the previous ones for the kernel
    package. Each kernel live package is tied to the exact kernel revision for
    which it is issued. The live patch package version number increases with
    every addition of fixes. To determine the kernel patching status, use the
    <command>klp -v patches</command> command.

    <title>Live patches versus kernel updates</title>
    <para>
      Live patches contain only critical fixes, and they do not replace regular
      kernel updates that require a reboot. Consider live patches as temporary
      measures that protect the kernel until a proper kernel update and a
      reboot are performed.

      The diagram below illustrates the overall relationship between live
      patches and kernel updates. The list of CVEs and defect reports addressed
      by the currently active live patch can be viewed using the <command>klp
      -v patches</command> command.

      It is possible to have multiple versions of the kernel package installed
      along with their live patches. These packages do not conflict. You can
      install updated kernel packages along with live patches for the running
      kernel. In this case, you may be prompted to reboot the system. Users
      with &slea; Live Patching subscriptions are eligible for technical
      support as long as there are live patch updates for the running kernel.
    </para>
    <para>
      With &klpa; activated, every kernel update comes with a live patch
      package. This live patch does not contain any fixes and serves as a seed
      for future live patches for the corresponding kernel. These empty seed
      patches are called <literal>initial patches</literal>.
