    <title>The libvirt concept</title>
    <meta name="maintainer" content="shalaka.harne@suse.com" its:translate="no"/>
    <abstract>
      <para>
        libvirt is a collection of software that provides a common API (Application Programming Interface) for managing popular virtualization solutions, for example KVM and Xen. libvirt consists of an API library, a system service libvirtd, and a command line utility virsh.        
      </para></abstract></info>
      <para>Using the libvirt-based tools is a recommended way of managing VM Guests. You can use virsh to configure virtual machines (VM) on the command line as an alternative to using the Virtual Machine Manager. Interoperability between libvirt and libvirt-based applications has been tested and is an essential part of SUSE's support stance.</para>
    <para>The <literal>libvirtd</literal> service runs on the server and performs management tasks such as starting, stopping, and migrating guests between host servers. The libvirt client libraries and utilities connect to libvirtd and collect configuration information and resources of the host servers. </para>
  <para>The configuration of each virtual machine is stored in an xml file and you can manage this configuration in different ways. To manage the configuration on the command-line, you can use <command>virsh</command></para>
  <para>The management of virtual machines on command-line provides more control over the host machines than using the graphical interface applications. This also enables you to add on to scripting and automation.</para>
   <para>You can use the <literal>virsh</literal> command-line utility to manage virtual machines. This enables you to start, configure, pause, list, and stop virtual machines. You can also manage virtual disks using this utility.
  </para><note><para>You must be a root user to manage virtual machines using virsh. However, as a non-root user you enter an unprivileged libvirt session in which you can not see or interact with any virtual machines.</para></note>
