<info><title>What is &libvirt;?</title>
  <meta name="maintainer" content="shalaka.harne@suse.com" its:translate="no"/>
  <abstract>
    <para>libvirt is a collection of software that provides a common API (Application Programming Interface) for managing popular virtualization solutions, for example, KVM, Hypervisor.framework, QEMU, Xen, Virtuozzo, VMWare ESX, and so on. libvirt consists of an API library, a system service libvirtd, and a command line utility virsh. </para></abstract>
  </info> 
  <para>The modular architecture of libvirt allows developers to extend the functionality. Using libvirt, live migration of virtual machines between physical hosts is possible without downtime and this facilitates in load balancing and maintenance.</para>
<para>&libvirt; allows remote management of Virtual Machines and Host resources for multiple VM hosts and is a single tool for different hypervisors. &libvirt; has graphical user interface and commandline to write XML configurations. </para>

      <section><title>How does &libvirt; work?</title>
       <info><abstract><para>The &libvirtd; service runs on the VM host. The &libvirt; client libraries and utilities connect to &libvirtd; and collect configuration information and resources of the host servers.</para></abstract></info>
        <para>The configuration of each virtual machine is stored in an XML file, and you can manage this configuration in different ways. </para>
        
        <para>You can configure virtual machines managed by &libvirt; using command-line or using Virtual Machine Manager. Interoperability between libvirt and libvirt-based applications are tested and is an essential part of SUSE's support stance.
          </para>    
          <para>&libvirt; tools are designed to work with the &libvirt; API and support various virtualization technologies and hypervisors. Some of the commonly used tools for libvirt are virsh, virt-manager, virt-install, virt-clone, virt-image, and so on. Libvirt supports using graphical user interface and commands to write XML configurations.</para>
          <para>Using the &libvirt;-based tools is the recommended way of managing VM Guests. For example, you can use <command>virsh</command> to configure virtual machines (VM) on the command line as an alternative to using the graphical &vmm;. You can also manage virtual disks using this tool.</para>
          <para>The management of virtual machines on command line provides more control over the host machines than using the graphical interface applications.</para>

        <info><abstract><para>Some of the major advantages of using &libvirt; through command-line are listed below:</para></abstract></info>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para>Allows basic monitoring of host and virtual machines.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Allows automating and scripting complex virtualization tasks and workflows.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Enables remote management of virtualization host. This helps in managing virtualization resources on remote servers over SSH or other secure protocols.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Allows managing headless servers. In server environments, where systems may not have a graphical interface or GUI tools installed, the command-line tool is the only option for managing virtualization.</para></listitem>
