  <abstract><para>
    Virtual Machine Manager is a GUI (graphical user interface) application for configuring virtual machines managed by libvirt.</para></abstract></info>
    <para>You can start the Virtual Machine Manager by running the <command>virt-manager</command> command from the command line. The Virtual Machine Manager displays the summary of running domains, their live performance and resource utilization statistics. Use wizards to create new domains, configure and adjust resource allocation and virtual hardware.</para>
    <note><para>Some configuration changes take effect immediately after you make the changes in the GUI, while others need a reboot of the machine. The Virtual Machine Manager warns you that you must reboot the machine.</para>
</note>
<para>Listed below are a few configuration options available on Virtual Machine Manager:</para>
<variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
    <term>View details of the VM Guest</term>
    <listitem><para>The Details view of the Virtual Machine Manager displays detailed information about the VM Guest's complete configuration and hardware equipment. Using this view, you can also change the guest configuration or add and modify virtual hardware to an existing virtual machine.</para></listitem>
  </varlistentry><varlistentry><term>View Performance Statistics of CPU and memory usage as well as disk and network I/O</term>
  <listitem><para>The Performance view shows regularly updated charts of CPU and memory usage, and disk and network I/O. </para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>Configure basic hardware</term>
  <listitem><para>You can setup the virtualized processor and memory. In the CPUs section, you can configure the number of virtual CPUs allocated to the VM Guest. Logical host CPUs shows the number of online and usable CPUs on the VM Host Server. In the Configuration you can configure the CPU model and topology. </para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>Configure boot options</term>
<listitem><para>You can configure options affecting the VM Guest boot process.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>Configure Storage, Controllers, Networking, Input devices</term>
  <listitem><para>You can configure both hard disks and removable media, such as USB or CD-ROM drives in Storage. Controllers and Networking allows you to add and configure new controllers and network device respectively. The configuration of input devices such as mouse, keyboard or tablet is possible through the Input option.</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>Assign a host PCI device to a VM Guest</term><listitem><para>You can directly assign PCI devices on the VM Host Server to guests (PCI pass-through). When the PCI device is assigned to one VM Guest, it cannot be used on the host or by another VM Guest unless it is re-assigned. A prerequisite for this feature is a VM Host Server configuration as described in FIXME . </para></listitem></varlistentry>
