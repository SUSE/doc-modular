    <para>
      The root volume is set to the size specified by the cloud vendors, for
      example, 10&nbsp;GB in AWS and GCE and 30&nbsp;GB in Azure.
    </para>
    <para>
      The recommended size for &productnameshort; is 12&nbsp;GB. However, the
      size depends on the number and size of workloads you intend to run.

    <para>
      As with each run of the &tr-up; command, a new snapshot is created. Keep
      in mind that these snapshots also take up some size, even though Btrfs
      snapshots are space-efficient.
    </para>
    <para>
      The root volume automatically grows as you change the size of the
      underlying disk. When you are running low on disk space, you can always
      stop your instance and increase the size of the system disk, up to the limitation
      of individual disk sizes in each cloud framework.
