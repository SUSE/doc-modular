    <title>Introduction to &slsa; &minvm;</title>

  <para>
    You can easily figure out what &slsa; &minvm; is and what it does from its
    name. The <literal>&slsa;</literal> part reveals that it is a product
    derived from &sls;. <literal>Minimal</literal> means that you are getting a
    substantially slimmed-down version of &slsa;. And the <literal>VM</literal>
    abbreviation (it stands for Virtual Machine) points to the main usage
    scenario &slsa; &minvm; is built for: it can act as a foundation for
    building systems for use in a data center, creating virtual application
    images, and building appliances. In other words, <emphasis>&slsa; &minvm;
    is a nimble and versatile &slsa; variant that you can tailor for a wide
    range of uses.</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>
    Because &slsa; &minvm; is based on &sls;, this gives you several important
    advantages right out of the box.

        Since both systems share the same code base, <emphasis>you do not have
        to certify &slsa; &minvm; if you already have &slsa;
        certification.</emphasis>

        The fact that you can customize &slsa; &minvm; by installing only the
        required components and nothing else means that there are fewer
        packages to manage and patches to apply. <emphasis>This also reduces
        the attack surface, thus making the resulting system more
        secure.</emphasis>

        &slsa; &minvm; features a lightweight Linux kernel, and <emphasis>the
        system is easy to deploy, extend, and customize.</emphasis>
