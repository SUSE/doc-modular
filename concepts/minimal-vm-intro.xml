    &minvm; is a slimmed-down version of &sles; designed to act as a foundation
    for building systems for use in a data center, creating virtual application
    images, and building appliances.
  </para>
  <para>
    Because &minvm; is based on &slsa;, it offers several important
    advantages right out of the box.

        Since both systems share the same code base, <emphasis>you do not have
        to certify &minvm; if you already have &slsa;
        certification.</emphasis>

        &minvm; can be customized by installing only packages required for the
        specific use case. This means that there are fewer packages to manage
        and patches to apply. The limited selection of packages also makes the system more secure by reducing the attack surface.
