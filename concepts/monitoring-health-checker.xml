        This topic provides an overview of the health
        checker.
      </para>

  <para>
    <literal>health-checker</literal> is a program delivered with &productnameshort; that checks
    whether services are running properly during booting of your system.
  </para>
  <para>
    During the boot process, &systemd; calls <literal>health-checker</literal>,
    which in turn calls its plug-ins. Each plug-in checks a particular service or
    condition. If each check passes, a status file
    (<filename>/var/lib/misc/health-check.state</filename>) is created. The
    status file marks the current root file system as correct.
  </para>
  <para>
    If any of the <literal>health-checker</literal> plug-ins reports an error, the action taken
    depends on a particular condition, as described below:
  </para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term><emphasis>The snapshot is booted for the first time.</emphasis></term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          If the current snapshot is different from the last one that worked
          properly, an automatic rollback to the last working snapshot is
          performed. This means that the last change made to the file
          system has broken the snapshot.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term><emphasis>The snapshot has already booted correctly in the past.</emphasis></term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          There could be just a temporary problem, and the system is rebooted
          automatically.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term><emphasis>The reboot of a previously correctly booted snapshot has failed.</emphasis></term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          If there was already a problem during boot and automatic reboot has
          been triggered, but the problem persists, then the system is
          kept running to enable the administrator to fix the problem. The
          services that are tested by the <literal>health-checker</literal> plug-ins are stopped if
          possible.
        </para>
