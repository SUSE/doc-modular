  <para>
  Health checker is a program delivered with &priductnameshort; that checks whether
  services are running properly during booting of your system.
 </para>
 <para>
  During the boot process, <literal>systemd</literal> calls Health checker,
  which in turn calls its plugins. Each plugin checks a particular service or
  condition. If each check passes, a status file
  (<filename>/var/lib/misc/health-check.state</filename>) is created. The
  status file marks the current root file system as correct.
 </para>
 <para>
  If any of the health checker plugins reports an error, the action taken
  depends on a particular condition, as described below:
 </para>
 <variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
   <term><emphasis>The snapshot is booted for the first time.</emphasis></term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     If the current snapshot is different from the last one that worked
     properly, an automatic rollback to the last working snapshot is performed.
     This means that the last change performed to the file system broke the
     snapshot.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term><emphasis>The snapshot has already booted correctly in the past.</emphasis></term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     There could be just a temporary problem, and the system is rebooted
     automatically.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term><emphasis>The reboot of a previously correctly booted snapshot has failed.</emphasis></term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     If there was already a problem during boot and automatic reboot has been
     triggered, but the problem still persists, then the system is kept running
     to enable to the administrator to fix the problem. The services that are
     tested by the health checker plugins are stopped if possible.
