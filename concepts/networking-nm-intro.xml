        &nm; is a program that manages the primary network connection and other
        connection interfaces. &nm; has been designed to be fully automatic by
        default. &nm; is handled by &systemd; and is shipped with all necessary
        service unit files.

  <para>
    &nm; stores all network configuration as a connection, which is a
    collection of data that describes how to create or connect to a network.
    These connections are stored as files in the
    <filename>/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/</filename> directory.
  </para>
  <para>
    A connection is active when a particular device uses the connection. The
    device may have more than one connection configured, but only one can be
    active at a given time. The other connections can be used to fast switch
    from one connection to another. For example, if the active connection is
    not available, &nm; tries to connect the device to another configured
    connection.
  </para>
  <para>
    To manage connections, use the <command>nmcli</command> command, described
    in the <xref linkend="nmcli-usage"/>.
