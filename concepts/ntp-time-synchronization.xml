    <title>What is time synchronization?</title>
    <para>
      Maintaining an accurate and synchronized system time on the computer is
      vital for teamwork. Planning and calendaring applications rely on it to
      track time correctly and notify users about appointments on time. For
      clustered applications, individual host machines often require
      synchronized system time for mutual communication.
    </para>
    <para>
      The built-in hardware clock is not a reliable time source. A manual
      correction of the system time may cause malfunction of critical
      applications due to sudden time leaps. Therefore, the system time needs
      to be synchronized against an external reliable time source over the
      network.

    <title>What is NTP?</title>
    <para>
      The &ntp; (NTP) is designed to synchronize the system time over the
      network. Its goal is to maintain the absolute time and use it to
      synchronize the system time of all machines within a network. synchronize
      the system time of all machines within a network.

    <title>How does NTP work?</title>
    <para>
      When the NTP service is properly configured, it continuously queries and
      adjusts the system time with reliable time servers. Typically, home
      computers and other devices connected to the internet are configured to
      query a public time server on the Internet.

      Conversely, desktop computers and servers that reside inside a corporate
      subnet are configured to query a dedicated time server within the local
      network. The time server itself synchronizes its time with a public time
      server.
