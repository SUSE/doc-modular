      <para>
       The toolchain components include the following tools: the GNU C library, the Gcc and G++
       compilers, <literal>binutils</literal>, GDB and  LLVM. Each of the components update
       strategy is described in corresponding sections.

    <title>GNU C library (<literal>glibc</literal>)</title>
    <para>
      The initial <literal>glibc</literal> version is <emphasis>2.40</emphasis>. The package is
      updated with each minor &slea; release if there are reasons for changes to the package (for
      example feature requests, performance tuning and so on). 
    </para>
    <para>
      Updates of the package provide a dynamic-linking backward compatibility to let programs built
      on the previous &slea; 16 releases functional. On contrary, symbols deprecated in the
      upstream <literal>glibc</literal> version will not be declared for the compiler and not
      available for link editing (static linking). Such cases, when source level and static linking
      backward compatibility is not guaranteed, are properly documented.
