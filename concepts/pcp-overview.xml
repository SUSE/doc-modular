        For performance monitoring purposes, &slma; provides a container image
        that enables you to run the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) analysis toolkit
        in a container. The toolkit comprises tools for gathering and
        processing performance information collected either in real time or
        from PCP archive logs.

    The performance data is collected by <emphasis>performance metrics domain
    agents</emphasis> and passed to the
    <systemitem class="daemon">pmcd</systemitem> daemon. The daemon coordinates
    the gathering and exporting of performance statistics in response to
    requests from the PCP monitoring tools. <command>pmlogger</command> is then
    used to log the metrics. For details, refer to the
