    Podman is a short name for Pod Manager Tool. It is a daemonless container
    engine that enables you to run and deploy applications using containers
    and container images. Podman provides a command line interface to manage
    containers.
  </para>
  <para>
    As Podman does not have a daemon, it provides integration with systemd.
    This makes it possible to control containers via systemd units. You can
    create these units for existing containers as well as generate units that
    can start containers if they do not exist in the system. Moreover, Podman
    can run systemd inside containers.
  </para>
  <para>
    Podman enables you to organize your containers into pods. Pods share the
    same network interface and resources. A typical use case for organizing a
    group of containers into a pod is a container that runs a database and a
    container with a client that accesses the database.
