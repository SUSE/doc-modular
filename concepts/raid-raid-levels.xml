    <abstract>
      <para>
        RAID implies several strategies for combining several hard disks in a
        RAID system, each with different goals, advantages, and
        characteristics. These variations are commonly known as RAID levels.
      </para>
    </abstract>
  </info>
  <para>
    The RAID levels can be split into the following categories:
  </para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Standard levels</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          These levels and their associated data formats are standardized by
          the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) in the Common RAID
          Disk Drive Format (DDF) standard. The standard RAID levels are RAID
          0, RAID 1, RAID 2, RAID 3, RAID 4, RAID 5 and RAID 6. For details,
          refer to <xref linkend="standard-raid-levels"/>.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Nested levels</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Combine already existing arrays into a new array. For example, RAID
          0+1 or RAID 1+0.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Non-standard levels</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Usually, these are proprietary RAID configurations designed to meet
          specific needs, for example, Linux MD RAID 10.

  <section xml:id="standard-raid-levels">
    <title>Standard RAID levels</title>
    <para>
      Originally, there were only five standard levels of RAID, but other
      levels have evolved as described in the following sections.
    </para>
    <section xml:id="raid-0-level">
      <title>RAID 0</title>
      <para>
        RAID 0 improves the performance of your data operations by spreading
        out blocks of each file across multiple disks. This data distributions
        is called striping. The overall capacity is a sum of capacity of disk
        in the RAID. The benefit of RAID 0 is that the throughput of read and
        write operations to any file is multiplied by the number of drives
        because reads and writes are done concurrently.
      </para>
      <para>
        The disadvantage of RAID 0 is that it does not provide any data backup,
        so if a disk fails, the whole RAID is destroyed and there is data loss.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="raid-1-level">
      <title>RAID 1</title>
      <para>
        RAID 1 provides adequate security for your data, because the data is
        copied to another hard disk 1:1. This is known as <emphasis>hard disk
        mirroring</emphasis>. This level does not provide striping, so it does
        not provide a higher read or write throughput. However, the array
        continues to operate as long as at least one drive is functioning.
      </para>
      <para>
        RAID 1 requires at least two devices.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="raid-2-level">
      <title>RAID 2</title>
      <para>
        In RAID 2, the striping is performed on a bit level. This RAID level is
        currently not used in practice.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="raid-3-level">
      <title>RAID 3</title>
      <para>
        In RAID 3, the striping is performed on a byte level with a dedicated
        parity drive. RAID 3 is not commonly used in practice.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="raid-4-level">
      <title>RAID 4</title>
      <para>
        RAID 4 provides block-level striping with a dedicated parity drive.
        If a data disk fails, the parity data is used to create a replacement
        disk. However, the parity disk might create a bottleneck for write
        access. This level requires at least three devices.
      </para>
      <para>
        RAID 4 is not commonly used in practice.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="raid-5-level">
      <title>RAID 5</title>
      <para>
        RAID 5 is an optimized compromise between Level 0 and Level 1 in terms
        of performance and redundancy. The hard disk space equals the number of
        disks used minus one. The data is distributed over the hard disks as
        with RAID 0, including the parity data. Parity blocks are there for
        security reasons. They are linked to each other with XOR, enabling the
        contents to be reconstructed by the corresponding parity block in case
        of system failure.
      </para>
      <para>
        With RAID 5, no more than one hard disk can fail at the same time. If
        one hard disk fails, it must be replaced when possible to avoid the
        risk of losing data.
      </para>
      <para>
        RAID 5 requires at least three disks.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="raid-6-level">
      <title>RAID 6</title>
      <para>
        RAID 6 consists of block-level striping with double distributed parity.
        RAID 6 provides extremely high data fault tolerance by sustaining
        multiple simultaneous drive failures. Even if two of the hard disks
        fail, the system continues to be operational, with no data loss.
      </para>
      <para>
        The performance for RAID 6 is slightly lower but comparable to RAID 5
        in normal mode and single disk failure mode. It is very slow in dual
        disk failure mode. A RAID 6 configuration needs a considerable amount
        of CPU time and memory for write operations.
      </para>
      <para>
        RAID 6 requires at least four disks. In general, it requires N+2 disks,
        where N is the number of disks required to store data and 2 is for the
        dual parity.
      </para>

  <section xml:id="raid-nested-raids">
    <title>Nested RAID</title>
    <section xml:id="raid-nested-01">
      <title>RAID 0+1</title>
      <para>
        RAID 0+1, also called RAID 01, mirrors striped disks, so the data is
        replicated and shared at the same time. The minimum number of disks is
        four.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="raid-nested-10">
      <title>RAID 1+0</title>
      <para>
        RAID 1+0, also called RAID 10, is a combination of striping and
        mirroring. Data is distributed into several disks, and each of these
        disks is mirrored to another disk.
