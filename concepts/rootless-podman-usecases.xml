    <title>When to use rootless containers</title>

  <para>
    Improved security is the key advantage of using rootless containers. Similar to regular users, rootless containers cannot access and manipulate resources that require &rootuser; privileges. This safeguards the host system from malicious processes running within rootless containers.
  </para>
  <para>
    Because running containers in rootless mode provides better security and normally does not require any additional configuration, use it as the default method of deploying containers in most situations.
  </para>
  <para>
    A typical scenario for rootless containers would be running a development environment based on a Language &bci;. As long as the development environment does not require write access to the system files on the host, you can run it as a rootless container.
  </para>
  <para>
    Rootless containers also make it possible for multiple regular users to run containers on the same machine. This can particularly useful for deploying containers in high-performance computing environments.
