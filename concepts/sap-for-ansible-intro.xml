      Ansible Automation is required for SAP landscapes because manually managing the complex, critical and often vast SAP environments is time-consuming, error-prone and struggles to meet
      modern demands for agility and high availability. Leveraging Ansible allows organizations to implement Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) principles for SAP, ensuring speed, consistency, and repeatability in
      vital tasks like provisioning new systems, patching, configuration management and performing complex operational procedures like &hana; System Replication failovers.
