      The SELinux booleans supports a flexible policy management approach.
      Booleans enable you to, for example, disable a particular policy on one
      server, while keeping the same policy active on another one. In other
      words, a boolean can be understood as a switch of a policy rule. Intead
      of changing a particular policy, you can switch it off. In the policy
      code, booleans are called a <emphasis>tunable</emphasis>. With the
      booleans being included in the policy, they are available once a policy
      is loaded.

      The changes to the booleans value may be persistent or just temporary
      till the session is ended.

      SELinux offers tools that enable you to list, view details or change the
      state of booleans. See the following sections for details.
