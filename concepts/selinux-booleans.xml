  <para>
    &selnx; Booleans support a flexible policy management approach.
    For example, Booleans enable you to disable a particular policy on one
    server, while keeping the same policy active on another one. In other
    words, a Boolean can be understood as a switch for a policy rule. Instead of
    changing a particular policy, you can switch it off. In the policy code,
    Booleans are called a <emphasis>tunable</emphasis>. Because Booleans are included in the policy, they are available as soon as a policy is loaded.

  <para>
    The changes to the Booleans value may be persistent or temporary, lasting until
    the end of the session.
