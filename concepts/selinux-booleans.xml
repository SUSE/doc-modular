  <para>
    &selnx; booleans offer a mechanism for administrators to dynamically modify
    specific aspects of the &selnx; policy.
    Their primary purpose is to accommodate common operational workloads that,
    if permitted by default in the main policy, could potentially reduce the
    baseline security posture of a general-purpose system.
  </para>
  <para>
    Instead of requiring the development and compilation of custom policy rules,
    booleans encapsulate predefined policy adjustments.
    This allows selectively enabling or disabling specific functionalities on
    an as-needed basis.
  </para>
  <para>
    These changes can be applied at runtime and take effect immediately.
    Administrators can configure booleans to be effective temporarily for the
    current session or persistently across reboots.
