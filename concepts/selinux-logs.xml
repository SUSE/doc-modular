        This topic covers how to find, search, and interpret &selnx; denial messages.

  <para>
    When &selnx; blocks an action, it generates a detailed log message. Understanding these logs is the most important skill for troubleshooting and auditing the system's security with &selnx;.
  </para>
  <para>
    The primary service responsible for handling &selnx; logs is the Audit daemon, <command>auditd</command>. On a standard system, this service is enabled by default.
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">With `auditd` running (Default):</emphasis> All &selnx; log messages are written to <filename>/var/log/audit/audit.log</filename>.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis role="bold">Without `auditd` running:</emphasis> If the <command>auditd</command> service fails or is not running, &selnx; log messages can be found instead in the <emphasis>the systemd journal</emphasis> as a fallback.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
  The most common log messages that are created by &selnx; are <emphasis role="bold">Access Vector Cache (AVC) denials</emphasis>, which record that a process was denied permission to access an object.
  </para>
  <para>
  An AVC denial is a symptom, not the problem itself, so it is important to understand why the denial occurred.
  When initially setting up a workload or on upgrade scenarios, &selnx; blocking actions might be easily fixed by using the tools discussed in <xref linkend="selinux-administration"/>.
  In contrast, AVCs occuring at later stages when the workload is running for while, might indicate a blocked intrusion attempt.
