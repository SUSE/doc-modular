      The topic focuses on &selnx; modes.
      </para>
    </abstract>
  </info>
  <para>
   &selnx; can run in one of three modes: <literal>disabled</literal>,
   <literal>permissive</literal>, or <literal>enforcing</literal>.
  </para>
  <para>
   Using the <literal>disabled</literal> mode means that no rules from the
   &selnx; policy are applied and your system is not protected. Therefore, the
   <literal>disabled</literal> mode is not recommended.
  </para>
  <para>
   In the <literal>permissive</literal> mode, &selnx; is active, the security
   policy is loaded, the file system is labeled and access denial entries are
   logged. However, the policy is not enforced and thus no access is actually
   denied.
  </para>
  <para>
   In the <literal>enforced</literal> mode, the security policy is applied.
   Each access that is not explicitly allowed by the policy is denied.
  </para>
  <para>
    For information about switching between &selnx; modes, refer to <xref linkend="selinux-switching-modes"/>.
