  <para>
    In the SELinux ecosystem, various policy types, such as the widely used targeted policy, are designed with distinct security concepts and enforcement methodologies to address diverse requirements.

    &productnameshort; &productnumber; is shipped with the <literal>targeted</literal> &selnx; policy by default.
  </para>
  <para>
   The design of this policy prioritizes the confinement of long-running and network-facing services, particularly on server systems.
  </para>
  <para>
   While the default targeted policy is designed to cover the most common use cases in default configuration, specialized workloads often need policy adjustments. For instance, scenarios involving custom network ports or unique file system layouts will require administrators to refine the existing policy.
  </para>
  <para>
   To facilitate such modifications, SELinux offers various tools. Administrators and developers can customize the default policy to their specific requirements.
