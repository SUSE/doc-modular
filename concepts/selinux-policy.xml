  <para>
   The policy is the key component in &selnx;. Your &selnx; policy defines
   rules that specify which objects can access which files, directories, ports,
   and processes on a system. To do this, a security context is defined for all
   of these.
  </para>
  <para>
   An &selnx; policy contains a huge number of rules. To make it more
   manageable, policies are often split into modules. This allows the
   administrator to switch protection on or off for different parts of the
   system.
  </para>
  <para>
   When compiling the policy for your system, you will have a choice to either
   work with a modular policy, or a monolithic policy, where one huge policy is
   used to protect everything on your system. It is strongly recommended to use
   a modular policy and not a monolithic policy. Modular policies are much
   easier to manage.
