  <para>
    The policy is the key component in &selnx;. In &selnx;, Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is implemented through security labels known as &selnx; contexts.
    Each process and system resource is assigned a unique &selnx; security context, also referred to as an &selnx; label.
    An &selnx; context is an identifier that focuses only on the security properties of the entity.
    This provides a consistent and unambiguous method for referencing objects within the &selnx; policy.
  </para>
  <para>
    A &selnx; policy contains a huge number of security contexts and access rules between those
    security contexts. These are split into modules.
    This allows the administrator to customize policies for different parts of the
    system.
