        The topic describes the &selnx; policy basics.

  <para>
    The policy is the key component in &selnx;. In &selnx;, Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is implemented through security labels known as &selnx; contexts.
    Each process and system resource is assigned a unique &selnx; context, also referred to as an &selnx; label.
    An &selnx; context is an identifier that focuses only on the security properties of the entity.
    This provides a consistent and unambiguous method for referencing objects within the &selnx; policy.
  </para>
  <para>
    An &selnx; policy contains a huge number of rules. To make it more
    manageable, policies are often split into modules. This allows the
    administrator to switch protection on or off for different parts of the
    system.
  </para>
  <para>
    When compiling the policy for your system, you will have a choice to either
    work with a modular policy, or a monolithic policy, where one huge policy
    is used to protect everything on your system. We strongly recommend using a
    modular policy and not a monolithic policy. Modular policies are much
    easier to manage.
