        The topic covers the basics about &selnx;.
      </para>
    </abstract>
  </info>
  <para>
    &selnx; was developed as an additional Linux security solution that uses
    the security framework in the Linux kernel. The purpose was to allow for a
    more granular security policy that goes beyond the standard Discretionary
    Access Controls (DAC), the traditional file permissions of
    owner/group/world, and read/write/execute.
  </para>
  <para>
   &selnx; implements Mandatory Access Control (MAC). Each process and system resource has a security label called an &selnx; context.
   Also called an &selnx; label, it is an identifier that contains information about a system object, such as files and network sockets.
   These labels are used to make access control decisions.
  </para>
  <para>
    The default action of &selnx; is to deny any access. &selnx; allows only
    actions that are specifically allowed in the &selnx; policy. Another
    feature of &selnx; that increases security is that &selnx; allows strict
    confinement of processes up to the point where the processes cannot access
    files of other processes on the same system.
  </para>
  <para>
    &selnx; was designed to enhance existing security solutions, not to replace
    them. For example, discretionary access control (DAC) is still applied,
    even if the system is using &selnx;. If DAC denies access first, &selnx; is
    then not used as the access was already blocked by another mechanism.
    &selnx; is present on the pre-built images by default.
