       The topic covers the basics about &selinux;.

  </info>
  <para>
  &selinux; was developed as an additional Linux security solution that uses the
  security framework in the Linux kernel. The purpose was to allow for a more
  granular security policy that goes beyond the standard Discretionary Access
  Controls (DAC), the traditional file permissions of owner/group/world, and
  read/write/execute.
 </para>
 <para>
  &selinux; uses labels attached to objects (for example, files and network
  sockets) and uses them for access decisions.
 </para>
 <para>
  The default action of &selinux; is to deny any access. &selinux; allows only
  actions that were specifically allowed in the &selinux; policy. Another feature
  of &selinux; that increases security is that &selinux; allows strict confinement
  of processes up to the point where the processes cannot access files of other
  processes on the same system.
 </para>
 <para>
  &selinux; was designed to enhance existing security solutions, not to replace
  them. For example, discretionary access control (DAC) is still applied even
  if the system is using &selinux;. If DAC denies access first, &selinux; is then
  not used as the access was already blocked by another mechanism.

 <section xml:id="sec-switching-modes">
  <title>&selinux; modes</title>
  <para>
   &selinux; can run in one of three modes: <literal>disabled</literal>,
   <literal>permissive</literal>, or <literal>enforcing</literal>.
  </para>
  <para>
   Using the <literal>disabled</literal> mode means that no rules from the
   &selinux; policy are applied and your system is not protected. Therefore, the
   <literal>disabled</literal> mode is not recommended.
  </para>
  <para>
   In the <literal>permissive</literal> mode, &selinux; is active, the security
   policy is loaded, the file system is labeled and access denial entries are
   logged. However, the policy is not enforced and thus no access is actually
   denied.
  </para>
  <para>
   In the <literal>enforced</literal> mode, the security policy is applied.
   Each access that is not explicitly allowed by the policy is denied.
  </para>

      Before starting the configuration of &selinux;, you should know a bit about how &selinux; is organized. Three components play a role:
