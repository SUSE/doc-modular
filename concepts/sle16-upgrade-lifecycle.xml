        &productname; (&productnameshort;) allows upgrading an existing system to a later version
        or. No new installation is required. Existing data, such as home and data directories and
        system configuration, is kept intact. Whether it is better to upgrade or perform a fresh
        installation depends on your specific scenario.

      &sls; 16 introduces a new naming schema for versions, using minor releases like 16.0 and
      16.1. Minor releases are scheduled annually and always in November. Each minor release has 24
      months of general support, giving you 12 months overlap with the next minor release. The last
      minor release 16.6 will have 48 months of general support to complete a 10 year lifecycle.
      General support is expected to end in in November 2035. Additional Long Term Support (LTS) is
      available for 3 years for all service packs, with LTS and Extreme LTS beyond 2040.

      <title>Upgrading versus fresh installation</title>
      <para>
        Upgrades between two releases of &productname; are supported by &suse;.
        Whether it is better to upgrade or perform a fresh installation depends on your specific
        scenario. While upgrades involve less work, fresh installations ensure you benefit from all
        the new features of a release such as disk layout changes, specific filesystem features, and
        other improvements. To get the most out of your system, &suse; therefore recommends fresh
        installations in most scenarios.
      </para>

      <para>
        In both cases&mdash;upgrade as well as a fresh installation&mdash;customers
        need to check if system settings and default values still fit their
        requirements.
