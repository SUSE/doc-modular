        &productname; (&productnameshort;) allows upgrading an existing system to a later version.
        No new installation is required. Existing data, such as home and data directories and
        system configuration, is kept intact. Whether it is better to upgrade or perform a fresh
        installation depends on your specific scenario.

    <title>Product lifecycle</title>
    <para>
      &sls; 16 introduces a new naming scheme for versions, using minor releases like 16.0 and
      16.1. Minor releases are scheduled annually and always in November. Each minor release has 24
      months of general support, giving you 12 months overlap with the next minor release. The last
      minor release, 16.6, will have 48 months of general support to complete a 10-year lifecycle.
      <phrase os="sles">General support is expected to end in November 2035. Additional Long Term
      Support (LTS) is available for 3 years for all service packs, with LTS and Extreme LTS beyond
      2040.</phrase>
      <phrase os="sles4sap">&productname; includes additional Long Term Support (LTS) for 3 years
      for all minor releases, giving you a total of 5 years overlap with the next minor release.

    <title>Upgrading versus fresh installation</title>
    <para>
      Upgrades between two major versions of &productname; are supported by &suse;.
      Whether it is better to upgrade or perform a fresh installation depends on your specific
      scenario. While upgrades involve less work, fresh installations ensure you benefit from all
      the new features of a release, such as disk layout changes, specific file system features, and
      other improvements. To get the most out of your system, &suse; therefore recommends fresh
      installations in most scenarios.
    </para>
    <para>
      In both cases&mdash;an upgrade and a fresh installation&mdash;customers
      need to check if system settings and default values still fit their
      requirements.
