          SLES 15 supports AMD64 / Intel 64 (x86-64), IBM Power LE (ppc64le), IBM Z (s390x), and ARM64 (aarch64). The required minimum architecture level for x86-64 is x86-64-v1.

          SLES 16 supports AMD and Intel 64-bit architectures (x86-64-v2, preparing to run x86-64-v3), the 64-bit ARM architecture (ARMv8.0-A), IBM Power Systems, Little Endian (POWER9), and 64-bit IBM Z (z14). This leverages HWCAPs of glibc to prepare for v3-compiled libraries. IBM Z support is z14 in RHEL 10, and z16 in SLES 16

          In SLES 15 and earlier, YaST was used for installation, unattended and scripted installation, configuration, systems management, command line, and first boot configuration. Traditional SLES installations prior to 16 were based on YaST, including AutoYaST for deployment and configuration. YaST architecture was considered complex and difficult to contribute to. YaST provided exclusive Qt or ncurses user interfaces

              Installation (including unattended) transitions to Agama. Agama is a new installer with a web-based frontend, command-line interface, and API for integration. It minimizes what is done during installation in favor of SCM (Software Configuration Management) tools. Agama supports repeated config import.
