  <para>Btrfs subvolumes are separately mountable file systems within a physical 
    partition. The Btrfs file system is set up with subvolumes by default. 
    Snapshots in Btrfs are a type of subvolume that shares data with another 
    subvolume. They are created using the copy-on-write capabilities of Btrfs, 
    which allows them to be quickly created with minimal disk space usage. 
    Snapshots can be used to capture the state of a file system at a particular 
    point in time and to roll back to a previous state if needed.   
  </para>
  <para>A Btrfs subvolume has its own independent file and directory hierarchy.
    Unlike LVM logical volumes, which operate at the block level, Btrfs 
    subvolumes are file extent-based. A snapshot is also considered a subvolume,
    carrying the initial content of the original subvolume. Subvolumes appear 
    as directories and can be manipulated like any other directory, including 
    being renamed or moved.</para>
  <para>
    One of the primary purposes of subvolumes is to be explicitly included or 
    excluded from snapshots. When using a snapshot to roll back the system, we 
    need to ensure that data such as users' home directories, Web and FTP 
    server contents or log files do not get lost or overwritten during a rollback. 
    This is achieved by excluding certain Btrfs subvolumes from snapshots.
