  <para>Snapper is a tool that helps create and manage file system snapshots.
    File system snapshots allow keeping a copy of the state of a file system
    at a certain point of time. Snapper can create and compare snapshots, revert
    between snapshots, and supports automatic snapshot timelines. Snapper never
    modifies the content of snapshots.</para>
    <para>The standard setup of Snapper is designed to allow rolling back system
    changes. However, you can also use it to create on-disk backups of user data.
    As the basis for this functionality, Snapper uses the Btrfs file system and
    thinly provisioned LVM volumes with an XFS file system.</para>

  <section xml:id="snapper-interface">
    <title>Supported interface</title>
    <para>
      Snapper has a command-line interface and a &yast; interface.
      The command-line interface allows you to create, delete and compare
      snapshots, as well as undo changes made between snapshots.
      The &yast; interface provides a graphical user interface for managing snapshots.
      It automatically creates snapshots when you use &yast; to add, remove or 
      update software packages.</para>
      <para>Snapper lets you create and manage file system snapshots on the following
      types of file systems:</para>
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Btrfs, a copy-on-write file system for Linux that natively supports
        file system snapshots of subvolumes. Subvolumes are separately mountable
        file systems within a physical partition.
