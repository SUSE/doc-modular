  <para>&snapper; is set up as an undo and recovery tool for system
    changes. By default, the root partition (<filename>/</filename>) of 
    &productname; is formatted with <literal>Btrfs</literal>. Taking snapshots
    is automatically enabled if the root partition (<filename>/</filename>) 
    is big enough (more than approximately 16&nbsp;GB). 
    By default, snapshots are disabled on partitions other than <filename>/</filename>.</para>

    <section xml:id="snapper-default-settings">
    <title>&snapper; default settings</title>
      <para>By default, &snapper; on &productname; is automatically configured during 
      system installation if the following requirements are met:</para>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
  <para>Root partition size: &gt; 16&nbsp;GB</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para>Root partition file system: Btrfs</para>
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
 <para>Snapshots are created for the root partition only, and certain 
  directories are excluded by means of subvolumes. For the list of excluded subvolumes, 
  see <xref linkend="snapper-subvolumes"/>. For detailed information about the types
  of snapshots, the time and occasions of their creation, see <xref linkend="snapshot-types"/>.</para>
 <para>&snapper; provides automatic snapshot cleanup algorithms to prevent running 
        out of space on the root partition. These algorithms differentiate 
        between timeline snapshots and <emphasis>numbered</emphasis> snapshots 
        (administration plus installation snapshot pairs). The cleanup behavior can 
        be configured based on the following criteria:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Number limit: The system can be set to automatically delete old snapshots 
        when a certain count of snapshots is reached.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Age limit: Old snapshots can be deleted if they exceed a certain age, while 
        still preserving a number of snapshots for each time period (hourly, daily, monthly, yearly).</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><literal>Pre</literal> and <literal>post</literal> snapshot pairs: 
          <literal>pre</literal> and <literal>post</literal> snapshot pairs that do not 
          differ can be automatically deleted.</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>For numbered snapshots, which include administration and installation snapshot 
          pairs, the cleanup is controlled by parameters such as <literal>NUMBER_CLEANUP</literal>,
        <literal>NUMBER_LIMIT</literal>, <literal>NUMBER_LIMIT_IMPORTANT</literal>, and <literal>NUMBER_MIN_AGE</literal>. 
          The default values are 2&ndash;10 for <literal>NUMBER_LIMIT</literal> and 4&ndash;10 for
          <literal>NUMBER_LIMIT_IMPORTANT</literal>, meaning that only the youngest snapshots are kept.</para>
          <para>For timeline snapshots, the cleanup is based on the number of snapshots to keep for 
          each type (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly). For example, the last 24 hourly
          snapshots, the first daily snapshot from the last seven days, the first snapshot 
          made on the last day of the month for the last twelve months, and so forth. The parameters 
          include <literal>TIMELINE_CLEANUP</literal>, <literal>TIMELINE_MIN_AGE</literal> and 
          interval parameters such as <literal>TIMELINE_LIMIT_DAILY</literal>, 
          <literal>TIMELINE_LIMIT_HOURLY</literal> and so on.</para>
      <para>You can roll back to an existing snapshot at any time by booting from 
        the respective snapshot and making it active afterwards.</para> <!--For more details refer to ???.</para>-->
        <note>
          <title>Disabling &snapper; automatically and manually</title>
          <para>If your root partition is smaller than 16&nbsp;GB, the automatic creation 
          of snapshots as described above is disabled by default. In this case, 
          you can manually create snapshots.<!-- (refer to ??? for more instructions)--> Keep an 
          eye on the available disk space.</para><!-- (see ??? for more information)-->
          <para>To disable automatic snapshots even if your root partition is sufficiently 
          sized, disable snapshots manually during the installation in the partition setup

        <title>&snapper; on root</title> 
         <para>When &snapper; is configured to operate on root, every Btrfs subvolume is
         excluded by default.</para>
        <para>The default behavior of &snapper; is defined in a configuration file that 
         is specific for each partition or Btrfs subvolume. These configuration files reside
         under <filename>/etc/snapper/configs/</filename>.</para>

           <title>Enabling &snapper; in the installed system</title>
           <para>
            If you disabled &snapper; during the installation, you can enable it at
            any time later. To do so, create a default &snapper; configuration for the
            root file system by running:
           </para>
     <screen>&prompt.sudo;snapper -c root create-config /</screen>
           <para>
            Afterward, enable the different snapshot types as described in <!--<xref
            linkend="sec-snapper-setup-customize-auto-snapshots"/>.-->
           </para>
           <para>
            Note that on a Btrfs root file system, snapshots require a file system with
            subvolumes configured as proposed by the installer and a partition size of at
            least 16&nbsp;GB.

         <para>The primary use case for snapshots is to roll back the system

      <para>
        When creating a snapshot, no physical data copies are created. A snapshot only consists of 
        pointers to the respective data blocks. As long as the snapshot remains consistent with 
        the current system, it occupies almost no additional disk space (apart from the metadata 
        it contains). However, if a file is modified on the system, the changed data is recorded
        in the snapshot. Over time, as more changes accumulate and the snapshot diverges from 
        the live system, the snapshot's size increases accordingly.</para>
        <para>To prevent disks from running full (and the system becoming inoperable as a result), we 
        recommend having a minimal root file system size. The required size depends on system usage:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
        <para>The frequency of snapshot creation</para>
        </listitem>

        <para>The duration for which snapshots are retained</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
        <para>The rate of changes to the system</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
        <para>In general, the more snapshots you have, the longer they are kept, and the more 
          frequently the system changes, the larger the root partition needs to be.</para>
