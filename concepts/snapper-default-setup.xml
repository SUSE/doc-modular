  <para>&snapper; is set up as an undo and recovery tool for system
    changes. By default, the root partition (<filename>/</filename>) of 
    &productname; is formatted with <literal>Btrfs</literal>. Taking snapshots
    is automatically enabled if the root partition (<filename>/</filename>) 
    is big enough (more than approximately 16&nbsp;GB). 
    By default, snapshots are disabled on partitions other than <filename>/</filename>.</para>

      <title>&snapper; on root</title> 
    <para>When &snapper; is configured to operate on root, every Btrfs subvolume is
    excluded by default. This means that if a user has the subvolume <filename>/srv</filename>,
    &snapper; will not take snapshots of anything in <filename>/srv</filename> unless the user
    decides to specifically do so. This also means that if you add a subvolume to 
    <filename>/</filename> at any point in time, it will be excluded from &snapper;'s
    default snapshot behavior.</para>
   <para>The default behavior of &snapper; is defined in a configuration file that 
    is specific for each partition or Btrfs subvolume. These configuration files reside
    under <filename>/etc/snapper/configs/</filename>.</para>

      <title>Enabling &snapper; in the installed system</title>
      <para>
       If you disabled &snapper; during the installation, you can enable it at
       any time later. To do so, create a default &snapper; configuration for the
       root file system by running:
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.sudo;snapper -c root create-config /</screen>
      <para>
       Afterward, enable the different snapshot types as described in <!--<xref
       linkend="sec-snapper-setup-customize-auto-snapshots"/>.-->
      </para>
      <para>
       Note that on a Btrfs root file system, snapshots require a file system with
       subvolumes configured as proposed by the installer and a partition size of at
       least 16&nbsp;GB.

      <title>Snapshot types and numbers</title>
      <para>
        In &snapper;, <quote>0 single</quote> refers to the type and number 
        of a snapshot. The numbers in front of the snapshot type describe 
        the order in which the snapshots were created. The word after the 
        number describes the type of the snapshot. Snapshot <quote>0 single</quote>
        always refers to the current system. There might already be several other 
        snapshots depending on the uptime of your system and on whether you 
        already used &yast; or &zypper;.

    <title>Snapshot creation</title>
     <para>
     When a snapshot is created, both the snapshot and the original point to the
     same blocks in the file system. So, initially a snapshot does not occupy
     additional disk space. If data in the original file system is modified,
     changed data blocks are copied while the old data blocks are kept for the
     snapshot. Therefore, a snapshot occupies the same amount of space as the
     data modified. So, over time, the amount of space a snapshot allocates
     constantly grows. As a consequence, deleting files from a
     <literal>Btrfs</literal> file system containing snapshots may
     <emphasis>not</emphasis> free disk space!</para>
     <note>
       <title>Snapshot location</title>
       <para>
        Snapshots always reside on the same partition or subvolume on which the
        snapshot has been taken. It is not possible to store snapshots on a
        different partition or subvolume.
       </para>
      </note>
      <para>
       As a result, partitions containing snapshots need to be larger than
       partitions not containing snapshots. The exact amount depends strongly on the
       number of snapshots you keep and the amount of data modifications. As a rule
       of thumb, give partitions twice as much space as you normally would.
       To prevent disks from running out of space, old snapshots are automatically
       cleaned up.<!--Refer to <xref linkend="sec-snapper-setup-customize-archiving"/>
