    <title>Using &snapper; to undo changes</title>

    <abstract>
     <para>
      &snapper; on &productname; is preconfigured to serve as a tool that lets you
      undo changes made by <command>zypper</command> and &yast;. For this purpose,
      Snapper is configured to create a pair of snapshots before and after each
      run of <command>zypper</command> and &yast;. Snapper also lets you restore
      system files that have been accidentally deleted or modified. Timeline
      snapshots for the root partition need to be enabled for this
      purpose&mdash;see <!--
      <xref linkend="sec-snapper-setup-customize-auto-snapshots"/> for details. TODO: Add correct link-->

  </info>
     <para>By default, automatic snapshots as described above are configured for the
      root partition and its subvolumes. To make snapshots available for other
      partitions such as <filename>/home</filename> for example, you can create
      custom configurations.<!-- TODO: Add link to custom configurations-->
