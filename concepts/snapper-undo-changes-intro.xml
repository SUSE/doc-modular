    <title>Default snapshot configuration</title>

    <abstract>
     <para>
      &snapper; on &suselinux; is preconfigured to serve as a tool that lets you
      undo changes made by <command>zypper</command> and &yast;. It does this
      by creating a pair of snapshots before and after each run of <command>zypper</command> 
      and &yast;.</para>
    </abstract>
  </info>
    <para>When the root partition is set up with <literal>Btrfs</literal> during the
      installation, &snapper; is installed automatically and is preconfigured for 
      doing rollbacks of &yast; and &zypper; changes. Every time you start
      a &yast; module or a &zypper; transaction, two snapshots are created: a
      <quote>pre</quote> snapshot capturing the state of the file system before
      the start of the module, and a <quote>post</quote> snapshot after the module
      has been finished.</para>
  <para>
    Taking snapshot pairs upon installing packages with &yast; or &zypper; is
    handled by <systemitem class="resource">snapper-zypp-plugin</systemitem>. An XML
    configuration file, <filename>/etc/snapper/zypp-plugin.conf</filename>, defines 
    when to make snapshots. By default, the file looks like the following:
   </para>
<screen linenumbering="numbered">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;snapper-zypp-plugin-conf&gt;
&lt;solvables&gt;
&lt;solvable match="w"<co xml:id="zypp-conf-match"/> important="true"<co xml:id="zypp-conf-important"/>&gt;kernel-*<co xml:id="zypp-conf-kernel"/>&lt;/solvable&gt;
&lt;solvable match="w" important="true"&gt;dracut&lt;/solvable&gt;
&lt;solvable match="w" important="true"&gt;glibc&lt;/solvable&gt;
&lt;solvable match="w" important="true"&gt;systemd*&lt;/solvable&gt;
&lt;solvable match="w" important="true"&gt;udev&lt;/solvable&gt;
&lt;solvable match="w"&gt;*&lt;/solvable&gt;<co xml:id="zypp-conf-packages"/>
&lt;/solvables&gt;
&lt;/snapper-zypp-plugin-conf&gt;</screen>
   <calloutlist>
    <callout arearefs="zypp-conf-match">
     <para>
      The match attribute defines whether the pattern is a Unix shell-style
      wild card (<literal>w</literal>) or a Python regular expression
      (<literal>re</literal>). For more information about regular expressions in Python,
      refer to <link xlink:href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html">Regular expression operations</link>.
     </para>
    </callout>
    <callout arearefs="zypp-conf-important">
     <para>
      If the pattern matches and the corresponding package is marked as
      important (for example, kernel packages), the snapshot will also be
      marked as important.
     </para>
    </callout>
    <callout arearefs="zypp-conf-kernel">
     <para>
      Pattern to match a package name. Based on the setting of the
      <literal>match</literal> attribute, special characters are
      interpreted as shell wild cards or regular expressions. This pattern
      matches all package names, starting with <literal>kernel-</literal>.
     </para>

    <callout arearefs="zypp-conf-packages">

      This line unconditionally matches all packages without marking the snapshot important.

    </callout>
   </calloutlist>
   <para>
    With this configuration, snapshot pairs are made whenever a package is
    installed (see <xref linkend="zypp-conf-packages"/>). When the kernel, dracut, glibc, systemd, or udev packages
    marked as important are installed, the snapshot pair will also be marked
    as important. All rules are evaluated.
   </para>
   <!--<para>By default, automatic snapshots as described above are configured for the
    root partition and its subvolumes. To make snapshots available for other
    partitions such as <filename>/home</filename>, for example, you can create
    custom configurations.
   </para> -->
   <para>&snapper; also lets you restore system files that have been accidentally
     deleted or modified. Timeline snapshots for the root partition need to be 
     enabled for this purpose.</para>
