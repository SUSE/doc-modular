    <title>REWORD! Using Snapper to undo changes</title>

        Snapper on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is preconfigured to serve as a tool 
        that lets you undo changes made by zypper and YaST. For this purpose, Snapper 
        is configured to create a pair of snapshots before and after each run of zypper 
        and YaST. Snapper also lets you restore system files that have been accidentally 
        deleted or modified. Timeline snapshots for the 
        root partition need to be enabled for this purpose — see Section 10.1.4.1, 
        “Disabling/enabling snapshots” for details.
