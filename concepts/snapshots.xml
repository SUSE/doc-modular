    This chapter describes managing snapshots and gives details about directories included in snapshots.

  <para>
   As snapshots are crucial for the correct functioning of &productnameshort;, do not
   disable the feature, and ensure that the root partition is big enough to
   store the snapshots.

 <para>
  When a snapshot is created, both the snapshot and the original point to the
  same blocks in the file system. So, initially a snapshot does not occupy
  additional disk space. If data in the original file system is modified,
  changed data blocks are copied while the old data blocks are kept for the
  snapshot.
 </para>
 <para>
  Snapshots always reside on the same partition or subvolume on which the
  snapshot has been taken. It is not possible to store snapshots on a different
  partition or subvolume. As a result, partitions containing snapshots need to
  be larger than partitions which do not contain snapshots. The exact amount
  depends strongly on the number of snapshots you keep and the amount of data
  modifications. As a rule of thumb, give partitions twice as much space as you
  normally would. To prevent disks from running out of space, old snapshots are
  automatically cleaned up.
