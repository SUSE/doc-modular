    &sudo; is a Linux command that is used to temporarily execute programs as
    another user.
    It is the abbreviation for <literal>super user do</literal> and can be used
    to run a command as &rootuser; user.
  </para>
  <para>
    As a normal user on Linux, you have reduced permissions which is sufficient
    for most of the tasks. The &rootuser; user is the Linux superuser and the
    equivalent to the administrator who has maximum permissions to do anything
    to the system.
  </para>
  <para>
    For security reasons, all &productname; systems separate the normal user
    from the &rootuser; user. 
    For example, as a normal user, you cannot write to system directories or
    install programs. 
    Any user with access to the &rootuser; password can gain this privileges and
    accidentally or maliciously break the system. 
    For example, you are logged in as normal user and accidentally browsing to
    a malicious website. An attacker cannot install malware on your system
    behind your back, as you are logged in as normal user without admin
    permissions.
  </para>
  <para>
    It is not recommended to be logged in as root permanently. A safer approach
    is logging in as a normal user and running a restricted command prefaced
    with &sudo;.
  </para>
  <para>
    On a single-user machine, where you have set your own root password, you can
    administer your system using &sudo; and configure &sudo; yourself.
    For more information about how to configure &sudo; refer to ???.
  </para>
  <para>
    In a multi-user environment, such as in companies, the &sudo; privileges are
    managed by a system administrator and the permissions of the &rootuser; user
    can be restricted. For example, even when running a command with &sudo; you
    may not be allowed to change certain system directories or files.
  </para>
     <para>
   </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      To use the &sudo; command, you have to have the &sudo; package available
      on your system. This is installed on all &productname; distributions by
      default.
