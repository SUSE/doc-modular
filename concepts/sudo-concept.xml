    <title>What is &sudo;?</title>
    <para>
      &sudo; is an abbreviation for <quote>super user do.</quote> It is a Linux command that you can use to execute programs as a &rootuser; user.
      &sudo; gives you elevated privileges when you want to run important commands.
      The &rootuser; user is the Linux superuser and the equivalent to the administrator who has maximum permissions to do anything to the system.

      As a normal user on Linux, you have reduced permissions. For example, you cannot write to system directories.
      For security reasons, the normal user is separate from the &rootuser; user.
      You must have &rootuser; privileges to run commands which can only be executed
      by the &rootuser;.
      The following options to log in as &rootuser; are available:
