    &sudo; is a Linux command that is used to temporarily execute programs as
    another user.
    It is the abbreviation for <literal>substitute user and do</literal> and
    borrows the privileges of another user, for example, the &rootuser; user.
    This way, &sudo; helps you accomplish system administration tasks without
    logging in as &rootuser;.
  </para>
  <section xml:id="sudo-basic-concepts-general">
    <title>&sudo; on Linux systems in general</title>
  <para>
    As a regular user on Linux, you have reduced permissions that are sufficient
    for most of the tasks. The &rootuser; user is the Linux superuser and the
    equivalent to the administrator.
  </para>
  <para>
    &sudo; allows specified (non-&rootuser;) users or a group of users to run
    privileged tasks, like calling system functions as &rootuser; or another
    user. Through a configuration file, the system administrator can control
    which users are allowed to run &sudo; commands and for which tasks.
  </para>
</section>
<section xml:id="sudo-basic-concepts-suse">
  <title>&sudo; on &productname; sytems</title>
  <para>
    For security reasons, all &productname; systems separate the regular user
    from the &rootuser; user.
    As a regular user, you cannot write to system directories or install
    programs. Any user with access to the &rootuser; password can gain these
    privileges and accidentally or maliciously break the system.
  </para>
  <para>
    For example, you are logged in as a regular user and accidentally browse to
    a malicious website. An attacker cannot install malware on your system
    behind your back, as you are logged in as a regular user, means without any
    administrative permissions.
  </para>
  <para>
    As explained above, it is not recommended to be logged in as &rootuser; user
    permanently for security reasons. A safer approach is to stay logged with
    your regular user and running a restricted command prefaced with &sudo;.
  </para>
  <note>
    <title>&sudo; requires administrator rights</title>
    <para>
      On a single-user machine, where you have set your own &rootuser; password,
      you have the required rights to administrate your system by using the
      &sudo; command and to configure &sudo; settings yourself.
    </para>
    <para>
      For more information about how to configure &sudo;, refer to
<link xlink:href="https://documentation.suse.com/smart/systems-management/html/
sudo-c onfigure-superuser-privileges/index.html"/>.
    </para>
    <para>
      In a multi-user environment, such as in companies, the &sudo; privileges
      are managed by a system administrator and the permissions of the
      &rootuser; user can be restricted. You may not be allowed to change
      certain system directories or files, even when executing the command with
      &sudo;.
    </para>

  <section xml:id="sudo-basic-concepts-how-works">
    <title>How &sudo; works</title>
    <para>
      When running a command prefaced with &sudo;, the system asks you for the
      password of the &rootuser; account. After successful authentication, the
      command is executed with superuser privileges.
    </para>
    <para>
      Depending on the &sudo; configuration, the elevated privileges persist for a
      certain period of time and as long as you are working in the same terminal
      session. So you do not need to provide the &rootuser; password again when
      running another &sudo; command.
    </para>
    <para>
    To run a command with &sudo;, this syntax is used:
  </para>
  <screen>
    &prompt.user;<command>sudo [command]</command>
      </screen>
  <para>
    The following example explains how the &sudo; command is used to open
    the <guilabel>&yast; Control Center</guilabel> in the terminal directly. To
    open &yast;, administrator rights are needed and therefore, it only works
    with the &sudo; command.
  </para>
  <example>
    <title>Opening the &yast; control center with &sudo;</title>
    <screen>
&prompt.user;<command>yast</command>
Absolute path to 'yast' is '/usr/sbin/yast', so running it may require superuser privileges (eg. root).<co xml:id="co-sudo-usage-yast-answer"/>
&prompt.sudo;<command>yast</command>
[sudo] password for root:<co xml:id="co-sudo-usage-pw"/>
         </screen>
         <calloutlist>
          <callout arearefs="co-sudo-usage-yast-answer">
           <para>
            When only the <command>yast</command> command is entered, the system
            returns that &rootuser; privileges are required.
           </para>
          </callout>
          <callout arearefs="co-sudo-usage-pw">
           <para>
            Starting the <command>yast</command> command with &sudo; prompts
            you for the &rootuser; password. The password is not shown during
            input, neither as clear text nor as masking characters.
           </para>
           <para>
            After successful authentication, the
            <guimenu>&yast; Control Center</guimenu> is opened.
           </para>
          </callout>
          </calloutlist>
         <para>
            The elevated privileges persist for a certain period of time, so you
            do not have to provide the &rootuser; password again for the next
            &sudo; command.
           </para>
