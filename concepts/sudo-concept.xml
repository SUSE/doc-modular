    &sudo; is a Linux command that is used to execute programs as another user.
    It is the abbreviation for <literal>super user do</literal> and can be used
    to run a command as &rootuser; user, means with elevated privileges.
  </para>
  <para>
    As a normal user on Linux, you have reduced permissions. The &rootuser; user
    is the Linux superuser and the equivalent to the administrator who has
    maximum permissions to do anything to the system.
    Depending on the system configuration, the permissions of the &rootuser; can
    be restricted. 
  </para>
  <para>
    For security reasons, all &productname; systems separate the normal user
    from the &rootuser; user. 
    For example, as a normal user, you cannot write to system directories or
    install programs. 
    Any user with access to the &rootuser; password can gain this privileges and
    accidentally or maliciously break the system. Therefore it is not
    recommended to log in as root.
    A safer approach is logging in as a normal user and running the command
    prefaced with &sudo; or <command>su</command> to gain root privileges.
  </para>
  <para>
    Each &productname; system, offers the following options to log in as
    &rootuser;:

        &sudo;: allows you to run a command as &rootuser; and, depending on it's
        configuration, it may not require the &rootuser; password. All commands
        executed with <command>su</command> are logged.

        <para>
         <command>su</command>: allows you to run a command as &rootuser; but
         requires you to know the &rootuser; password. The commands executed
         with <command>su</command> are not logged.

      To use the &sudo; command, you have to have the &sudo; packageaailale on
      your system. This is installed on all &productname; distributions by
      default.
