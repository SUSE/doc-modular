       &sudo; provides a means to securely and efficiently delegate superuser
       privileges to specific users or groups.

    <para>
      Certain operations on a Linux system require &rootuser; or administrator
      privileges. Home users who administer their own system do not have to
      delegate superuser privileges, because the administrator and the normal
      user are the same person in this scenario. But as soon as a system is part
      of a larger systems environment with multiple users,
      groups and hosts, it becomes vital to maintain control of who is allowed
      to do what and where. At the same time, it is important to provide all
      users and groups with the necessary privileges to carry out their tasks.

     In the new policy implemented in <literal>sudo-policy-wheel-auth-self</literal>package,
    it is important to know that the <literal>wheel</literal> group is used to track if a user can become a &rootuser;
    with the user password. The first user created by the $&ayguide; installer is added to the <literal>wheel</literal> group.

            &sudo; offers fine-grained control over users, groups, hosts and
             commands and thus increases system security by reducing the risk of
             malicious or accidental damage by an intruder or a
             system user.

            Whenever a user switches privileges, this appears in the system's
            log, and all operations carried out by this user with elevated
            privileges can be traced back to them.

            Using &sudo;, system administrators can enable single users or

            the &rootuser; password and switch to the &rootuser; account.

        This article provides in-depth &sudo; configuration information.
        However, it does not provide any advice on how to build a comprehensive
        and secure &sudo; policy. Security-related policies are very complex and
        strongly depend on the environment they are created for.
