  <para>
        In case of problems, a detailed system report may be created with the
        <command>supportconfig</command> command-line tool. The tool will
        collect information about the system, such as the current kernel
        version, hardware, installed packages, partition setup, and much more.        
      </para>
      <para>
        The command-line tool is provided by
      the package <systemitem>supportutils</systemitem> which is installed by
      default. However, <command>supportconfig</command> can integrate plug-ins that are used with each running of <command>supportconfig</command>. Which plug-ins are available on your system, depends on installed packages. The plug-ins are stored in the <filename>/usr/lib/supportconfig/plugins/</filename> directory.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <command>supportconfig</command> tool creates a TAR archive  with detailed system information that you can hand over to Global Technical Support.
