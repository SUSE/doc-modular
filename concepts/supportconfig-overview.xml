    If problems occur, you can use the
    <command>supportconfig</command> command-line tool to create a detailed system report. The tool collects
    information about the system, such as the current kernel version, hardware,
    installed packages, partition setup, and much more.
  </para>
  <para>
    The command-line tool is provided by the package
    <systemitem>supportutils</systemitem>, which is installed by default. If the package is not installed , install with
    the <command>zypper install supportutils</command> command.
    However, <command>supportconfig</command> can integrate plug-ins that are
    used with each running of <command>supportconfig</command>. Which plug-ins
    are available on your system, depends on installed packages. The plug-ins
    are stored in the <filename>/usr/lib/supportconfig/plugins/</filename>
    directory.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <command>supportconfig</command> tool creates a TAR archive with
    detailed system information that you can hand over to Global Technical
    Support.
