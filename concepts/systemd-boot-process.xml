     <para>
&systemd; manages the boot process on a Linux system. The boot process loads the Linux kernel, which is the core of the
operating system. The loaded kernel initializes hardware and starts the &systemd; process. This is the first process that runs
on the system. &systemd; starts the other system services, such as networking service, the login manager, etc. that
are required to bring the system up and running.</para>
<para>&systemd; runs these services parallelly. The login manager is displayed when all the required services are
  started and running. You can log in and start using the system. &systemd; runs in the background, managing and
  controlling the system services as required. </para>
