    <abstract>
     <para>
&systemd; manages the boot process on a Linux system. The boot process loads the Linux kernel, which is the core of the
operating system. The loaded kernel initializes hardware and starts the &systemd; process. This is the first process that runs
on the system. &systemd; starts the other system services, such as networking service, the login manager, etc. that
are required to bring the system up and running. Theses services also include mounting filesystems, probing hardware
initiating and terminating services, etc. </para>
<para>&systemd; runs these services parallelly. The login manager is displayed when all the required services are
  started and running. You can log in and start using the system. &systemd; runs in the background, managing and
  controlling the system services as required. </para>

  <title>System boot performance analysis</title>
  <para>You can use the <command>systemd-analyze</command> command to analyze the performance of the system
    boot process using &systemd;. The command can also be used to retrieve other state and trace information
    from the system and service manager. It is also used to check that unit files are correct and access special functions
    useful for advanced system manager debugging. </para>
