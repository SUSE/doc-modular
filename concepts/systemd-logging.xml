        Log files and journals are important for system administration. They give in-depth information about a system and are very important
        for troubleshooting and auditing. Log files contain events and messages generated by the kernel, applications, and users that log into the system.
 You can use the <command>journalctl</command>command to query the journal. This command views logs collected by &systemd;.
 The <literal>systemd-journald</literal> service is responsible for &systemd;'s log collection. <literal>systemd-journald</literal> saves the events and messages in a binary format.
