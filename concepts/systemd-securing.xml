    <title>Introduction to securing &systemd; services</title>
    <abstract>
      <para>
        Linux increases its security by separating privileges between individual components of the
        operating system. System services already have a default level of security. For example,
        their processes run under their own user ID, which limits the changes they can perform on
        the system.
      </para>

      <para>
        The default level of privilege separation provides only a basic protection. Services can
        still perform as many changes as normal local users, though not as many as &rootuser;. A
        higher level of system security requires limiting what services can perform and prevents
        them from certain privileges that normal users are allowed to use.

    <title>Why is securing &systemd; services important?</title>
    <para>
      Securing &systemd; services increases the security of the whole operating system and protects
      sensitive data contained on its file system.  With &systemd;, you can configure your system in many ways.
      &systemd; runs as the first process on boot (PID1) which means that it has a lot of power on your Linux environment.
    </para>
    <para>&systemd; has a command-line tool <command>systemd-analyze security</command>. This command analyses your services
    and tells you if your services are using its security options.</para>
