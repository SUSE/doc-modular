    <title>Secure &systemd; services</title>
    <abstract>
      <para>
        Linux increases its security by separating privileges between individual components of the
        operating system. System services already have a default level of security. For example,
        their processes run under their own user ID, which limits the changes they can perform on the
        system.
      </para>

      <para>
        The default level of privilege separation provides only a basic protection. Services can
        still perform as many changes as normal local users, though not as many as &rootuser;.
        A higher level of system security requires limiting what services can perform and prevents
        them from certain privileges that normal users are allowed to use.

    <title>How does securing services with &systemd; work?</title>
    <para>
      There are several methods to secure processes and applications that you can use
      simultaneously. For example, confining with &selnx; or &aa; is recommended. &systemd; can
      apply additional restrictions to local services by using technologies included in the kernel.
      These restrictions are activated by adding specific options to the &systemd; service
      definition and restarting the service.

      Securing &systemd; services increases the security of the whole operating system and protects
      sensitive data contained on its file system.
