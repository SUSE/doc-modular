    <title>Structure of a unit file</title>

    <abstract>
     <para>
      Administration is easier when you understand units and units files when working with &systemd;.
     Unit files use a simple declarative syntax that allows you to see easily,
     the purpose and effects of a unit upon activation. Unit files have sections with directives, for example:
      </para>
    </abstract>
      </info>
      <screen>
        [Section]
        Directive1=value
        Directive2=value

        . . .
      </screen>
  <para>Unit files include the following sections:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term><literal>[Service]</literal></term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The <literal>[Service]</literal> section provides configuration that is only applicable for services.
          You must specify <literal>Type=</literal> in the <literal>[Service]</literal> section. This categorizes services
          by their process and daemon behavior. It instructs  &systemd; how to correctly manage the service and also determine its state.
          </para>
               </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term><literal>[Unit]</literal></term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
         The first section found in most unit files is the <literal>[Unit]</literal> section. This section is used to define
         the metadata of the unit and configure the relationship of the unit to other units. This section if usually placed
         at the top because it provides an overview of the unit.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>[Install]</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
         This is often the last section in the unit file and is optional. This section is used to define the behavior of a unit when
         it is enabled or disabled. When you enable a unit, it automatically starts at boot. </para>
              </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
