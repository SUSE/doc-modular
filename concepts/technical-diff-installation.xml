    <title>What happened to &yast;?</title>
    <para>
      For installation, &slea;&nbsp;16 comes with installer images based on a new technology called
      &agama;. The single purpose of &agama; is to install a new system and not to serve as a
      management tool like &yast; was.
    </para>
    <para>
      &agama; images are delivered in several flavors. To name several of them:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          minimal &ndash; for installation from network
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          full &ndash; with a full copy of the package repositories for all product flavors
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
remote installation &ndash; deployment using the PXE client
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      &agama; also supports unattended installation while reatining a large degree of compatibility
      with &ay; regarding the file format and data schema. However, &agama; is not a fully
      compatible drop-in replacement for &ay;. Even though, you can use existing profiles to a
      large degree, adjustments to the profiles is expected. There is also a new, much more powerful profile schema based on json/jsonnet.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can install &slea;&nbsp;16 using repositories provided by a local &rmt; server inside the
      customer's network. There is no &rmt; version based on &slea;&nbsp;16 yet. However. &rmt;&nbsp;15  is
      fully supported as installation source for &slea;&nbsp;16.
    </para>

  <section xml:id="sle16-differences-faq-installation-rescue">
    <title>Where is the rescue system?</title>
    <para>
      The &agama; installation images no longer come with a separate rescue system. In a future
      release of &slea;&nbsp;16, we plan to provide a separate image for this purpose.</para>
      <para> To enter a rescue
      shell (without starting &agama;), you can use the live media. Alternatively, you can
      use the &agama; image to access the installed for diagnosis and repair in any of the following ways:
        </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          boot the  installation image, switch to another virtual console and log in as &rootuser;
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          boot the installation image and open a terminal window
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          boot the installation image and before starting the Linux kernel, add
          <literal>3</literal> to the kernel CLI. This will boot into runlevel 3, skipping the graphical system and thus the installer.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      Any of these methods will give you a root shell that should allow you to access your root partition. Many of the tools needed to repair/recover a potentially broken installation should be available inside the &agama; live media.
    </para>
