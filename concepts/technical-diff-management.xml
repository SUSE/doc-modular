  <title>Which management frameworks are available?</title>
  <para>
    The &yast; management tool is not shipped anymore, so for general 1:1 management tasks you can
    use the delivered &cockpit;. However, &cockpit; does not provide a full replacement, and some
    modules &yast; used are missing in it. For details regarding &cockpit;, refer to the <link
    xlink:href="https://documentation.suse.com/sles/16.0/html/SLES-cockpit/">&cockpit; guide</link>.
  </para>
  <para>
For management automation, &slea;&nbsp;16 supports &ansible;. &smlm; is another option for managing
&slea; 16 installations that use &salt; internally. However, &slea;&nbsp;16 itself does not contain &salt; packages.
  </para>
  <para>
    Support of WBEM has been dropped (in &slea; 15 it was provided by the SBLIM packages).

<section xml:id="sle16-differences-faq-management-update">
  <title>What has changed in the update stack and package management?</title>
  <para>
    In &slea;&nbsp;16, there are no modules anymore to distinguish between, for example, the base
    system, server applications or development packages. There are also no longer separate channels
    for <literal>pool</literal> and <literal>update</literal>. These changes, together with
    improvements to <command>zypper</command>, should result in better performance when applying updates. &slea; minor
    releases (aka 16.1, 16.2 and so on) will continue to have separate repositories.
  </para>
  <para>
    &slea;&nbsp;16  instances can register against (and receive updates from) an RMT server. Currently,
    the RMT service has to run on a &slea;&nbsp;15 instance as we do not support the RMT service on
    &slea;&nbsp;16 yet. RMT on &slea;&nbsp;16 is expected to be delivered with &slea;&nbsp;16.1.
