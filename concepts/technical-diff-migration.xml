  <para>
For migration from &slea;&nbsp;15 to &suselinux;&nbsp;16, we use a new approach to migration based on a technology called <emphasis>&suse; Migration Services</emphasis>.
  </para>
  <para>
    This technology uses a special medium that attempts the migration in several
    steps after booting. The first, pre-migration step analyzes the existing installation to identify problematic
    settings that cannot be converted automatically, such as AppArmor profiles. Such issues are
    flagged, and you are given the option to either accept an
    incomplete migration or cancel the process. In the second step, the system boots into a special medium that
    performs the actual migration. After that, the system boots into the migrated system and performs
    optional final tasks.
    </para>
    <para>
      Migration of a running system is no longer provided.
    </para>
    <para>
      &suselinux;&nbsp;16.1 is the target release for delivering full migration support. 16.0 provides limited 
      migration capabilities, supporting only migrations from &slea;&nbsp;15 SP7. Furthermore, the 
      tools in 16.0 do not cover all aspects of migration.
