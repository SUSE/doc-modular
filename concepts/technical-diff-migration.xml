  <para>
For migration from &slea; 15 to &slea; 16, we use a new approach to migration based on a technology called <emphasis>&suse; Migration Services</emphasis>.
  </para>
  <para>
    This technology utilizes a special media that after booting attempts the migration in several
    steps. The first, pre-migration step analyzes the existing installation to identify problematic
    settings that cannot be converted automatically, such as AppArmor profiles. Such issues are
    flagged and you are given the option to either accept an
    incomplete migration, or cancel the process. In a second step, the system boots into a special media that
    performs the actual migration. After that the system boots into the migrated system and performs
    optional final tasks.
    </para>
    <para>
      Migration of a running system is no longer provided.
    </para>
    <para>
      &slea; 16.1 is the target release for delivering a full migration support. With 16.0, we
      provide a limited migration&mdash;only from &slea; 15 SP7 and also the tools do not cover all
      aspects of migration.
