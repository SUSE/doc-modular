      Here is an explanation of terms that are specific to SSL/TLS encryption.

        <listitem>
          <para>
            <emphasis>Transport layer security</emphasis> (TLS) is a protocol
            that provides secure communication between client-server
            applications. TLS uses asymmetric cryptography with a pair of
            private and public keys. TLS is the successor to the SSL (Secure
            Sockets Layer) protocol.

        <listitem>
          <para>
            <emphasis>Secure socket layer</emphasis> (SSL) was the predecessor
            of the TLS protocol. SSL version 3.0 was replaced by TLS 1.0 in 1999
            to address existing vulnerabilities.

        <term>SSL/TLS certificate</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            A digital X.509 certificate that helps to secure communication
            within a client-server systems. Using TLS certificate, the client
            can authenticate the identity of the server and encrypt their mutual
            communication. The certificate usually includes information about
            its issuer (CA), identity of its holder, the associated public key,
            digital signature, and its validation period.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Public key</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            A part of a TLS certificate which acts as a digital identity for the
            server. When a client connects to the server over TLS, it requests
            the server's certificate, which contains the public key. The public
            key is freely distributable and is used for data encryption.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Private key</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            A counterpart to the public key in asymmetric cryptography. It is
            kept secret and known only to the owner of the key pair. When a
            client connects to a server over TLS, the server sends its digital
            certificate with a public key. The client uses it to encrypt data,
            ensuring that only the server's private key can decrypt it.

        <listitem>
          <para>
            Elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) is a
            cryptographic algorithm used to generate digital signatures based on
            the mathematics of elliptic curves. It is widely used for digital
            signature generation and verification in various cryptographic
            protocols and applications, including SSL/TLS for secure
            communication over the internet.

        <term>CA</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            A <emphasis>certificate authority</emphasis> (CA) responsible for
            issuing digital certificates that authenticate the identity of
            individuals, organizations, or servers on the internet. It can be
            either a publicly trusted CA, such as <link
            xlink:href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</link>, or a
            private CA in which case you sign the certificate yourself.

        <term>CSR</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            To have a certificate signed by a CA, you need to generate a public
            key and send it to the CA for signing. This process is called a
            <emphasis>certificate signing request</emphasis> (CSR).

          <para>
            An open-source software library that provides cryptographic
            functions and utilities to secure communication. It is used in
            &productnameshort; for implementing secure protocols such as
            SSL/TLS.

          <para>
            A series of messages exchanged between the client and the server to
            establish a secure connection. The process involves negotiating
            cryptographic parameters, authenticating identities, and agreeing on
            encryption keys before secure communication can begin.

    <title>How is secure communication established?</title>
    <para>
      The following steps illustrate the process of establishing secure
      communication between the client and the server. The process is often
      referred to as a <emphasis>handshake</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Client 'hello'</emphasis> The TLS handshake is
          started by the client sending a <literal>ClientHello</literal> message
          to the server. Such message includes information about the TLS
          protocol versions and cryptographic algorithms supported by the
          client, as well as a random value used for generating session keys.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Server 'hello'</emphasis> When the server
          receives the <literal>ClientHello</literal> message, it responds with
          a <literal>ServerHello</literal> message. Such message includes the
          TLS protocol version selected by the server, the selected
          cryptographic algorithm, and a random value. The server also sends its
          digital certificate that includes the public key.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Certificate verification</emphasis> After the
          client receives the server's certificate, the client verifies that it
          is signed by a trusted CA and that the server's domain name matches
          the one in the certificate.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Key exchange</emphasis> After the server's
          certificate is successfully verified, the client generates a secret
          and encrypts it with the server's public key from the certificate.
          This encrypted secret is sent to the server in a
          <literal>ClientKeyExchange</literal> message.
        </para>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Session key generation</emphasis> Both the
          client and the server use the exchanged data&mdash;client and server
          random values, and the generated secret&mdash;to generate a shared
          session key. This key will be used to encrypt and decrypt data
          transmitted during the TLS session. Both parties confirm that
          subsequent messages will be encrypted by sending a
          <literal>ChangeCipherSpec</literal> message.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Finished</emphasis> Finally, both the client and
          the server send a <literal>Finished</literal> message to confirm that
          the handshake is complete. These messages contain a hash of all
          preceding handshake messages, encrypted with the shared session key.
          If the hashes match on both sides, the handshake is successful and the
          secure TLS connection is established.

        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Confidentiality:</emphasis> Secure communication
          ensures that sensitive information remains confidential and cannot be
          accessed by unauthorized parties. This is particularly important for
          protecting personal data and financial information.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Integrity:</emphasis> Secure communication
          guarantees the integrity of transmitted data and ensures that it
          remains unchanged during transmission. This helps prevent unauthorized
          modification of data and maintain its accuracy and reliability.

        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Authentication:</emphasis> Secure communication
          allows parties to authenticate each other's identities, verifying that
          they are who they claim to be. This helps prevent impersonation and
          ensures that communication is conducted securely between trusted
          parties.

          helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements and industry
          standards related to data protection and privacy. Compliance with
          regulations such as GDPR often requires the implementation of secure
          communication protocols and practices.
