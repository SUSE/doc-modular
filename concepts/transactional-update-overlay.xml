       &productnameshort; was designed to use a read-only root file system. This means that after the deployment is complete, you are not able to perform direct modifications to the root file system.  Instead, &productnameshort; introduces the concept of transactional updates which enables you to modify your system and keep it up to date.

  <para>
      Even though <filename>/etc</filename> is part of the read-only file
      system, using an <literal>OverlayFS</literal> layer on this directory
      enables you to write to this directory. All modifications that you
      performed on the content of <filename>/etc</filename> are written to the
      <filename>/var/lib/overlay/<replaceable>SNAPSHOT_NUMBER</replaceable>/etc</filename>.
      Each snapshot has one associated <literal>OverlayFS</literal> directory.
    </para>
    <para>
      Whenever a new snapshot is created (for example, as a result of a system
      update), the content of <filename>/etc</filename> is synchronized and
      used as a base in the new snapshot. In the <literal>OverlayFS</literal>
      terminology, the current snapshot's <filename>/etc</filename> is mounted
      as <literal>lowerdir</literal>. The new snapshot's
      <filename>/etc</filename> is mounted as <literal>upperdir</literal>. If
      there were no changes in the <literal>upperdir</literal>
      <filename>/etc</filename>, any changes performed to the
      <literal>lowerdir</literal> are visible to the
      <literal>upperdir</literal>. Therefore, the new snapshot also contains
      the changes from the current snapshot's <filename>/etc</filename>.
    </para>
    <important>
      <title>Concurrent modification of <literal>lowerdir</literal> and <literal>upperdir</literal></title>
      <para>
        If <filename>/etc</filename> in both snapshots is modified, only the
        changes in the new snapshot (<literal>upperdir</literal>) persist.
        Changes made to the current snapshot (<literal>lowerdir</literal>) are
        not synchronized to the new snapshot. Therefore, we do not recommend
        changing <filename>/etc</filename> after a new snapshot has been
        created and the system has not been rebooted. However, you can still
        find the changes in the <filename>/var/lib/overlay/</filename>
        directory for the snapshot in which the changes were performed.

      <title>Using the <literal>--continue</literal> option of the <command>transactional-update</command> command</title>
      <para>
        When using the <option>--continue</option> option and the new snapshot
        is a descendant of the current snapshot, then the
        <filename>/etc</filename> overlays of all the snapshots in between will
        be added as additional directories to the <filename>lowerdir</filename>
        (the <filename>lowerdir</filename> can have several mount points).
