        &productnameshort; was designed to use a read-only root file system.
        This means that after the deployment is complete, you are not able to
        perform direct modifications to the root file system. Instead,
        &productnameshort; introduces the concept of transactional updates
        which enables you to modify your system and keep it up to date.
      </para>

  </info>
  <para>
    Even though <filename>/etc</filename> is part of the read-only file system,
    using an <literal>OverlayFS</literal> layer on this directory enables you
    to write to this directory. All modifications that you performed on the
    content of <filename>/etc</filename> are written to the
    <filename>/var/lib/overlay/<replaceable>SNAPSHOT_NUMBER</replaceable>/etc</filename>.
    Each snapshot has one associated <literal>OverlayFS</literal> directory.
  </para>
  <para>
    Whenever a new snapshot is created (for example, as a result of a system
    update), the content of <filename>/etc</filename> is synchronized and used
    as a base in the new snapshot. In the <literal>OverlayFS</literal>
    terminology, the current snapshot's <filename>/etc</filename> is mounted as
    <literal>lowerdir</literal>. The new snapshot's <filename>/etc</filename>
    is mounted as <literal>upperdir</literal>. If there were no changes in the
    <literal>upperdir</literal> <filename>/etc</filename>, any changes
    performed to the <literal>lowerdir</literal> are visible to the
    <literal>upperdir</literal>. Therefore, the new snapshot also contains the
    changes from the current snapshot's <filename>/etc</filename>.
  </para>
  <important>
    <title>Concurrent modification of <literal>lowerdir</literal> and <literal>upperdir</literal></title>
    <para>
      If <filename>/etc</filename> in both snapshots is modified, only the
      changes in the new snapshot (<literal>upperdir</literal>) persist.
      Changes made to the current snapshot (<literal>lowerdir</literal>) are
      not synchronized to the new snapshot. Therefore, we do not recommend
      changing <filename>/etc</filename> after a new snapshot has been created
      and the system has not been rebooted. However, you can still find the
      changes in the <filename>/var/lib/overlay/</filename> directory for the
      snapshot in which the changes were performed.
    </para>

  <note>
    <title>Using the <literal>--continue</literal> option of the <command>transactional-update</command> command</title>
    <para>
      When using the <option>--continue</option> option and the new snapshot is
      a descendant of the current snapshot, then the <filename>/etc</filename>
      overlays of all the snapshots in between will be added as additional
      directories to the <filename>lowerdir</filename> (the
      <filename>lowerdir</filename> can have several mount points).
