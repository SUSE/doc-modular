    <para>
      To keep the base operating system stable and consistent, the
      &productname; (&productnameshort;) uses a read-only root file system.
      Therefore, you cannot perform direct changes to the root file system, for
      example, by using the <command>zypper</command> command. Instead,
      &productnameshort; introduces <emphasis>transactional updates</emphasis>
      that allow you to apply one or more changes to the root file system.
    </para>

      Each time you call the &tr-up; command to change your system&mdash;either
      to install a package, perform an update, or apply a patch&mdash;the
      following actions take place:
    </para>
    <procedure>
      <title>Modifying the root file system</title>
      <step>
        <para>
          A new read-write snapshot is created from your current root file
          system, or from a snapshot that you specified.
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          All changes are applied (updates, patches or package installation).
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          The snapshot is switched back to read-only mode.
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          If the changes were applied successfully, the new root file system
          snapshot is set as default.
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          After rebooting, the system boots into the new snapshot.

          They are atomic&mdash;the update is applied only if it completes
          successfully.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          Changes are applied in a separate snapshot and so do not influence
          the running system.

      <title>Environment within transactional-update command</title>
      <para>
        Each time you run the &tr-up; command, the changes are performed in a
        separate snapshot, where some environment variables may have a
        different value, than in the shell you run the &tr-up; from. For
        example, the value of the <literal>PWD</literal> environment variable
        is not set to the directory you run the &tr-up; from, but it is set to
        <literal>/</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
        From within the new snapshot you cannot access the
        <filename>/var</filename> directory and this directory is also not
        included in the snapshot as described in
        <xref linkend="snapshots-excluded-dirs"/>. However, some directories
        are not included in the snapshot but are accessible from within the
        &tr-up; environment, for example, the <filename>/root</filename>
        directory.

    The current &productnameshort; image points to the following two software
    repositories:

    <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
    <term>ALP</term>
    <listitem>
    <para>
    <literal>https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/SUSE:/ALP:/PUBLISH/images/repo/ALP-0.1-x86_64-Media1/</literal>
    </para>
    <para>
    This repository is enabled. It is a subset of the build repository
    and an equivalent of the <literal>POOL</literal> repository known
    from other &suse; software products. It will remain unchanged until
    the release of the next &productnameshort; prototype.
    </para>
    <tip>
    <para>
    If you need a package which is not included in the
    <literal>ALP</literal> repository, you may find it in the
    <literal>ALP-Build</literal> repository. To enable it, run:
    </para>

    <para>
    This repository is disabled by default. It is used for building the

    be moving forward over the time with future development.
