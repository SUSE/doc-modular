    <title>What are transactional updates?</title>
    <para>
      To keep the base operating system stable and consistent, the
      &productname; uses a read-only root file system.
      Therefore, you cannot perform direct changes to the root file system, for
      example, by using the <command>zypper</command> command. Instead,
      &productnameshort; introduces <emphasis>transactional updates</emphasis>
      that allow you to apply one or more changes to the root file system.
    </para>
    <para>
      The default &tr-up; behavior is to create a new snapshot from the current
      root file system after each change. To apply the changes, you need to
      reboot the host. You cannot run the &tr-up; command multiple times without
      rebooting to add more changes to the snapshot. This action creates
      separate independent snapshots that do not include changes from the
      previous snapshots.
    </para>

    <title>How do transactional updates work?</title>
    <para>
      Each time you call the &tr-up; command to change your system&mdash;either
      to install a package, perform an update, or apply a patch&mdash;the
      following actions take place:
    </para>
    <procedure>
      <title>Modifying the root file system</title>
      <step>
        <para>
          A new read-write snapshot is created from your current root file
          system, or from a snapshot that you specified.
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          All changes are applied (updates, patches or package installation).
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          The snapshot is switched back to read-only mode.
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          If the changes were applied successfully, the new root file system
          snapshot is set as default.
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          After rebooting, the system boots into the new snapshot.
        </para>

    <title>Environment within the &tr-up; command</title>
    <para>
      Each time you run the &tr-up; command, the changes are performed in a
      new snapshot. The environment in the snapshot may differ from
      the one in the shell you run the &tr-up; command from. For example, the
      current working directory (<literal>$PWD</literal>) is not set to the
      directory from which you run the &tr-up;, but is set to
      <literal>/</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      From within the snapshot, you cannot access the
      <filename>/var</filename> directory. This directory is also not
      included in the snapshot. However, some directories
      are not included in the snapshot but are accessible inside the &tr-up;
      environment, for example, the <filename>/root</filename> directory.

    The current &productnameshort; image points to the following two software
    repositories:

    <term>ALP</term>

    </para>
    <para>
    This repository is enabled. It is a subset of the build repository
    and an equivalent of the <literal>POOL</literal> repository known
    from other &suse; software products. It will remain unchanged until
    the release of the next &productnameshort; prototype.
    </para>
    <tip>
    <para>
    If you need a package which is not included in the
    <literal>ALP</literal> repository, you may find it in the
    <literal>ALP-Build</literal> repository. To enable it, run:

    This repository is disabled by default. It is used for building the
