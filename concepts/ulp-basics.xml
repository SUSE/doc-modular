        live patching.

  <para>
    User space live patching (&ulpa;) refers to the process of applying patches
    to the libraries used by a running process without interrupting them. Every
    time a security fix is available as a live patch, customer services are
    secured after applying the live patch without restarting the processes.

      &ulpa; is supported on the following architectures:

  <para>
    Live patching operations are performed using the
    <systemitem>ulp</systemitem> tool that is part of
    <systemitem>libpulp</systemitem>. <systemitem>libpulp</systemitem> is a
    framework that consists of the <systemitem>libpulp.so</systemitem> library
    and the <command>ulp</command> binary that makes libraries live patchable
    and applies live patches.
