    <title>Live patching on &productnameshort;</title>
    <para>
      Only the currently running processes are affected by the live patches. As
      the libraries are changed in the new snapshot and
      <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> in the current one, new processes
      started in the current snapshot still use the non-patched libraries until
      you reboot. After the reboot, the system switches to the new snapshot and
      all started processes will use the patched libraries.
    </para>

  <para>
    User space live patching (&ulpa;) refers to the process of applying patches
    to the libraries used by a running process without interrupting them. Every
    time a security fix is available as a live patch, customer services are
    secured after applying the live patch without restarting the processes.
  </para>
  <para>
    Live patching operations are performed using the
    <systemitem>ulp</systemitem> tool that is part of
    <systemitem>libpulp</systemitem>. <systemitem>libpulp</systemitem> is a
    framework that consists of the <systemitem>libpulp.so</systemitem> library
    and the <command>ulp</command> binary that makes libraries live patchable
    and applies live patches.
