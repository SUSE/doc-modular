<literal>vhostmd</literal> is a daemon that runs in a host environment and provides a metrics
communication channel between the host and guest machines. The daemon provides the guest 
machine administrator with a limited set of host resource usage data (usually in read-only mode), 
to help analyze issues with the guest machine.

  <literal>vhostdmd</literal> writes metrics periodically to a disk. Which metrics to collect, the
