    <title>What is &systemd;?</title>
    <para>
      &systemd; is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems.
      It acts as the init system that brings up and maintains user space services when run as first process on boot (PID 1).
      PID 1 is known as <emphasis>init</emphasis> and is the first Linux user-mode process created.
      It runs until the system shuts down.
      </para>
      <para>&systemd; owns PID 1, and is started directly by the kernel. All other processes are either started directly
       by &systemd;, or one of its child processes.</para>
       <para>&systemd; is not directly initiated by the user, but installed through
        <filename>/sbin/init symlink</filename> and started during the early boot.</para>
        <para>&systemd; is the default initialization system for major Linux distributions. It is backward compatible SysV init scripts.
          SysV is an initialization system which predates &systemd;. </para>
          <para>In &systemd;, a unit is a resource that the system knows how to operate on and manage. This is
            the primary object that the &systemd; tools use and these resources are defined with configuration files called unit files.</para>
<para>For more information on &systemd;, refer to <command>man 1 systemd</command>.</para>
