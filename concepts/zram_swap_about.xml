      <para>
        <emphasis>Fast I/O operations</emphasis> &ndash; due to its RAM based
        nature, the block devices provide very fast access to data.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis>memory savings</emphasis> &ndash; as the data are compressed using zram, a decent
        amount of memory can be saved. Thus, zram uses RAM efficiently and is   particularly suitable in
        environment with low RAM size, for example, embedded systems.
      </para>
