    The following sections provides information about two tools that you can use to configure
    &productname; on the first boot. You can use either &combustion; and write a configration BASH
    script, or you can use &ignition; and use JSON. Alternatively, if you do not need a complex
    configuration or unattended configuration, you can skip this step as basic configuration can be
    performed using &jeosfirstboot; as described in <xref linkend="deployment-jeos-firstboot"/>.
