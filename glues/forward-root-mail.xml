  <para>
    System daemons, <systemitem class="daemon">cron</systemitem> jobs, &systemd; timers, and
    other applications can generate e-mails and send them to the &rootuser; user of the system.
    By default, each user account owns a local mailbox and will be notified about new mail
    messages upon login.
  </para>
  <para>
    These messages can contain security-relevant reports and incidents that might require a
    quick response by the system administrator. To get notified about these messages in a timely
    fashion, it is recommended to forward these mails to a dedicated remote e-mail account that
    is regularly checked.
