      &gnome; Remote Desktop supports operating as a remote assistance remote desktop server, as a
      single user remote desktop server, and as a remote login desktop server. 
      This even works headless, meaning the server does not require a graphics processing unit
      (GPU). This is particularly useful for servers, where a powerful system can serve multiple
      users without the need for graphics hardware.

      &gnome; Remote Desktop has two protocol backends, RDP and VNC. Not all modes of operation are
      supported with all protocol backends.
