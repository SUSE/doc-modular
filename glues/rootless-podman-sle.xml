    <title>Rootless &podman; on &sle;</title>
    <meta name="maintainer" content="dpopov@suse.com" its:translate="no"/>
  </info>
  <para>
    &podman; is the default container management and orchestration tool on &sle;. In addition to providing a drop-in replacement for &deng;, &podman; offers several advantages, including the ability to run containers in rootless mode. This allows regular users to deploy containers without elevated privileges. In other words, rootless mode means that you can deploy a container without becoming root or using &sudo;. 
  </para>
  <para>
    By default, &podman; launches containers as the current regular user.
    Support for rootless containers is enabled for all newly created users in
    &slea; by default, and no additional steps are necessary.

  <note>
    <title>Data storage for rootless containers</title>
  <para>
    When working with container images and containers as a regular user, all relevant data is stored in <filename>$HOME/.local/share/containers/storage</filename> instead of <filename>/var/lib/containers</filename>. Make sure that the home directory has enough storage space to accommodate the data.
