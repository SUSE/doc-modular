    &saptune; is a tool designed for tuning the operating system for running &sap; workloads. The tool simplifies the mandatory system tuning as described in various &sap; Notes. All the required tuning parameters are added to &saptune; notes and grouped these notes to solutions representing &sap; workloads. This ensures that no parameter is missed, while the &saptune; service applies all notes and solutions after each system reboot, thus keeping the system reliably tuned at all times.

  <important>
  <para>
  &saptune; is used exclusively for tuning the system for &sap; workloads, and not the &sap; workloads themselves. &saptune; does not make any changes to &sap; configuration files.
