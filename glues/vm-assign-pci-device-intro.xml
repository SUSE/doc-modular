    &libvirt; is a unified interface to multiple virtualization solutions. &libvirt; virtual
    machines are typically managed by either &virsh;, a command-line utility, or &vmm;, an
    application with a graphical user interface. Assigning &vmhost;'s PCI or USB devices to a
    &vmguest; dedicates the device's resources to the &vmguest;. The reasons for assigning a host
    device to a VM are near-native performance of the device, using its hardware acceleration
    capabilities, or isolating the device from other VMs to increase security.

    This article describes how to assign a &vmhost;'s device to a &vmguest; using both the &virsh;
    command-line utility and the &vmm; GUI application.
