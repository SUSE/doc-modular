    <para>
      By default, public endpoints such as &owui; are protected by self-signed
      SSL/TLS certificates. You also have the option to either have the
      certificate issued by a public Certification Authority (CA), or bring your
      own certificate (BYO). Except for the BYO case,
      <systemitem>cert-manager</systemitem> is required to facilitate the
      certificate management. Therefore, you must verify that the
      <systemitem>cert-manager</systemitem> <emphasis>custom resource
      definitions</emphasis> (CRDs) are installed using the
      <command>kubectl</command> utility, for example:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;<command>kubectl get crds | grep cert-manager</command>

      If the <literal>cert-manager</literal> CRDs are not installed, install

      <title>The version of <systemitem>cert-manager</systemitem></title>
      <para>
        In the above command, replace <literal>v1.6.2</literal> with the version
        of the <systemitem>cert-manager</systemitem> dependency included in the
        <filename>Chart.lock</filename> file from the unpacked &owui; &helm;
        chart.

    </tip>
    <para>
      For BYO certificates, <systemitem>cert-manager</systemitem> is not
      required. Therefore, you may disable it by adding the following option
      when installing the &productname; components via &helm;:
    </para>
