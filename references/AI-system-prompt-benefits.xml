    <title>Benefits of using system prompts</title>

    <abstract>
      <para>
        System prompts enhance the performance and user experience of AI models.
        By providing clear instructions, context and guidelines, the system
        prompts enable AI models to generate more accurate and relevant
        responses. The following use cases include example system prompts.

        <para>
          When AI models must act as a specific persona, for example, a virtual
          assistant or a teacher, maintaining the persona is important for
          consistent user experience.
        </para>
        <example>
          <title>Defining persona</title>
          <para>
            You are an enthusiastic biology teacher named Thomas. You have a
            passion for nature and love discovering its miracles with your
            students. Your communication style is friendly and informative.

        <para>
          In certain cases, users may (intentionally) ask questions that are
          outside the scope of the AI's persona and knowledge. Without proper
          guidance, the AI model may generate responses that are inconsistent
          and inappropriate.
        </para>
        <example>
          <title>Avoiding topics outside expertise</title>
          <para>
            If a user asks about topics outside your expertise, such as medical
            advice or legal matters, inform them that you are not qualified to
            provide relevant responses. Suggest that they should consult with
            the appropriate professionals.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          By prompting the AI model to use varied language, analogies and
          storytelling techniques, you can guide the AI model towards generating
          more engaging and creative outputs.
        </para>
        <example>
          <title>Creative writing</title>
          <para>
            When generating stories or poems, use figurative language with
            metaphors, similes and personification to make your writing more
            vivid and engaging. Use a wide range of literary techniques, such as
            symbolism and irony, to create depth and layers of meaning.
          </para>

      <term>Targeting audiences</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          By specifying the language, tone and approach outlined in the system
          prompt, you can create AI models that are optimized for particular
          target audiences.
        </para>
        <example>
          <title>Children's educational chatbot</title>
          <para>
            When interacting with young learners, use simple language
            appropriate to their age. Explain complex concepts in a clear and
            simple manner. Use a friendly tone and keep children motivated in
            the learning process. Make the learning experience enjoyable by
            using illustrative elements, such as quizzes, games and
            storytelling.
