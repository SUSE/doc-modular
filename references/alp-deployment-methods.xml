        &productnameshort; is distributed <phrase os="alp-other">either as a disk image of the
        &alp-installer; installer, or</phrase> as a pre-built raw disk image. You can
        deploy &productnameshort; either on a bare metal host, or as a
        virtualized guest on a &vmhost;. In the latter case, you need to
        prepare a new virtual machine first.

    <title>The &alp-installer; installer</title>
    <para>
      While the &alp-installer; installer handles both bare-metal and
      virtualized/cloud deployments, it is a preferred method for bare-metal
      deployments. &productnameshort; deployment using the &alp-installer;
      installer is similar to a traditional operating system setup. After
      booting the &alp-installer; installer image, the installer uses a
      graphical user-friendly interface to walk you through the system
      configuration and deployment.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        The installer live images do not contain <package>linuxrc</package>,
        <package>wicked</package> and <package>installation-images</package>
        packages. Therefore, the device activation and configuration need adjusting, and there is
        no interactive menu for configuring certain parameters of the installation.
      </para>

  <section xml:id="alp-deployment-raw-image">
    <title>Raw disk image</title>
    <para>
      This method handles both bare-metal and virtualized/cloud deployment. With the raw disk
      image, you do not boot an installer directly from the raw disk image that was previously copied
      to the main hard disk. On first boot, you can configure basic system options using an
      <emphasis>ncurses</emphasis> user interface. You can fine-tune the deployment setup with
      &combustion; and &ignition;
      tools.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are two types of images, depending on whether you intend to run &productnameshort; on
      an encrypted disk or an unencrypted disk.
