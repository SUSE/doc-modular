  <section xml:id="configuring-combustion-script">
    <title>The <filename>script</filename> configuration file</title>
    <para>
      The <filename>script</filename> configuration file is a set of commands
      that are parsed and executed by &combustion; in a &tr-up; shell. This
      article provides examples of configuration tasks performed by
      &combustion;.
    </para>
    <important>
      <title>Include interpreter declaration</title>
      <para>
        As the <filename>script</filename> file is interpreted by the shell,
        always start the file with the interpreter declaration on its first
        line. For example, in case of Bash:
      </para>
<screen>#!/bin/<replaceable>bash</replaceable></screen>
    </important>
    <para>
      To log in to your system, include at least the &rootuser; password.
      However, it is recommended to establish the authentication using SSH
      keys. If you need to use a &rootuser; password, make sure to configure a
      secure password. For a randomly generated password, use at least 10
      characters. If you create your password manually, use even more than 10
      characters and combine uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers.
    </para>
    <section xml:id="deployment-combustion-network">
      <title>Network configuration</title>
      <para>
        To configure and use the network connection during the first boot, add
        the following statement to <filename>script</filename>:
      </para>
<screen># combustion: network</screen>
      <para>
        Using this statement will pass the <literal>rd.neednet=1</literal>
        argument to dracut. The network configuration defaults to using DHCP.
        If a different network configuration is needed, proceed as described in
        <xref
        linkend="combustion-prepare-statement"/>.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you do not use the statement, the system will be configured without
        any network connection.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="combustion-prepare-statement">
      <title>Performing modifications in the initramfs</title>
      <para>
        You may need to perform changes to the initramfs environment, for
        example, to write a custom network configuration for &nm; into
        <filename>/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/</filename>. To do so,
        use the <literal>prepare</literal> statement.
      </para>
      <para>
        For example, to create a connection with a static IP address and
        configure DNS:
      </para>
<screen>
#!/bin/bash
# combustion: network prepare
set -euxo pipefail
          
nm_config() {
  umask 077 # Required for NM config
  mkdir -p /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/
  cat &gt;/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/static.nmconnection &lt;&lt;-EOF
  [connection]
  id=static
  type=ethernet
  autoconnect=true
          
  [ipv4]
  method=manual
  dns=192.168.100.1
  address1=192.168.100.42/24,192.168.100.1
  EOF
}
          
if [ "${1-}" = "--prepare" ]; then
  nm_config # Configure NM in the initrd
  exit 0
fi
          
# Redirect output to the console
exec &gt; &gt;(exec tee -a /dev/tty0) 2&gt;&amp;1
          
  nm_config # Configure NM in the system
  curl example.com
# Leave a marker
echo "Configured with combustion" &gt; /etc/issue.d/combustion</screen>

      <title>Partitioning</title>
      <para>
        &productnameshort; raw images are delivered with a default partitioning
        scheme as described in
        <xref linkend="deployment-default-partitioning"/>. You might want to
        use a different partitioning. The following set of example snippets
        moves the <filename>/home</filename> to a different partition.
      </para>
      <note>
        <title>Performing changes outside of directories included in snapshots</title>
        <para>
          The following script performs changes that are not included in
          snapshots. If the script fails and the snapshot is discarded, some
          changes remain visible and cannot be reverted, for example, the
          changes to the <literal>/dev/vdb</literal> device.
        </para>
      </note>
      <para>
        The following snippet creates a GPT partitioning schema with a single
        partition on the <literal>/dev/vdb</literal> device:
      </para>
<screen>
sfdisk /dev/vdb &lt;&lt;EOF
label: gpt
type=linux
EOF

partition=/dev/vdb1
</screen>
      <para>
        The partition is formatted to BTRFS:
      </para>
<screen>
wipefs --all ${partition}
mkfs.btrfs ${partition}
</screen>
      <para>
        Possible content of <filename>/home</filename> is moved to the new
        <filename>/home</filename> folder location by the following snippet:
      </para>
<screen>
mount /home
mount ${partition} /mnt
rsync -aAXP /home/ /mnt/
umount /home /mnt
</screen>
      <para>
        The snippet below removes an old entry in
        <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> and creates a new entry:
      </para>
<screen>
awk -i inplace '$2 != "/home"' /etc/fstab
echo "$(blkid -o export ${partition} | grep ^UUID=) /home btrfs defaults 0 0" >>/etc/fstab
</screen>

    <section xml:id="combustion-script-security">
      <title>Setting a password for &rootuser;</title>
      <para>
        Before you set the &rootuser; password, generate a hash of the
        password, for example, by using the <command>openssl passwd
        -6</command>. To set the password, add the following to the
        <filename>script</filename>:
      </para>
<screen>echo 'root:$5$.wn2BZHlEJ5R3B1C$TAHEchlU.h2tvfOpOki54NaHpGYKwdNhjaBuSpDotD7' | chpasswd -e</screen>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="combustion-script-sshkeys">
      <title>Adding SSH keys</title>
      <para>
        The following snippet creates a directory to store the &rootuser;'s SSH
        key and then copies the public SSH key located on the configuration
        device to the <filename>authorized_keys</filename> file.
      </para>
<screen>
mkdir -pm700 /root/.ssh/
cat id_rsa_new.pub >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
</screen>
      <note>
        <para>
          The SSH service must be enabled in case you need to use remote login
          via SSH. For details, refer to
          <xref linkend="combustion-script-services"/>.
        </para>

    <section xml:id="combustion-script-services">
      <title>Enabling services</title>
      <para>
        To enable system services, for example, the SSH service, add the
        following line to <filename>script</filename>:
      </para>
<screen>systemctl enable sshd.service</screen>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="combustion-script-install">
      <title>Installing packages</title>
      <important>
        <title>Network connection and registering your system may be necessary</title>
        <para>
          As some packages may require additional subscription, you may need to
          register your system beforehand. An available network connection may
          also be needed to install additional packages.
        </para>
      </important>
      <para>
        During the first boot configuration, you can install additional
        packages to your system. For example, you can install the
        <literal>vim</literal> editor by adding:
      </para>
<screen>zypper --non-interactive install vim-small</screen>
      <note>
        <para>
          Bear in mind that you will not be able to use
          <command>zypper</command> after the configuration is complete and you
          boot to the configured system. To perform changes later, you must use
          the <command>transactional-update</command> command to create a
          changed snapshot.
