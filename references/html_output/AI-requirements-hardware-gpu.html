    <P
>&#13;      Configuring and managing nodes with hardware resources can require
      multiple configurations for software components. These include drivers,
      container runtimes and libraries. To use NVIDIA GPUs in a Kubernetes
      cluster, you need to configure the NVIDIA GPU Operator. Because GPU is a special
      resource in the cluster, you need to install the following components to
      enable deployment of workloads for processing on the GPU.
