        The section focuses on how to change the &nm; behavior, changing or
        adding values in the configuration file.

  <para>
    The main configuration file for the &nm; is
    <filename>/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf</filename>. This file can
    be used to configure the behavior of &nm;.
  </para>
  <para>
    The file consists of sections of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair must
    belong to a section. A section starts with a name enclosed in
    <emphasis>[]</emphasis>. Lines beginning with a <emphasis>#</emphasis> are
    considered comments. The minimal configuration needs to include the
    <literal>[main]</literal> section with the <literal>plugins</literal>
    value:
  </para>
<screen>
[main]
plugins=keyfile
  </screen>
  <para>
    The <literal>keyfile</literal> plug-in supports all the connection types and
    capabilities of &nm;.
  </para>
  <para>
    The default configuration file contains the <literal>connectivity</literal>
    section that specifies the URI to check the network connection.
  </para>
  <para>
    On &productname;, you can also use other sections. For details, refer to
