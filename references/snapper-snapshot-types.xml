  <title>Types of snapshots</title>

  <abstract>
    <para>There are two aspects according to which snapshots can be classified: 
     snapshot-triggering events and the time of snapshot creation.</para>

  <section xml:id="snapshot-types-events">
    <title>Snapshot types based on triggering events</title>
    <para>
      Although snapshots themselves do not differ in a technical sense, we 
      distinguish between three types of snapshots, based on the events that trigger them.
    </para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
       <term>Timeline snapshots</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         A single snapshot is created every hour. Old snapshots are automatically
         deleted. By default, the first snapshot of the last ten days, months,
         and years is kept. Using the &yast; OS installation method (default),
         timeline snapshots are enabled, except for the root file system.

      <varlistentry>
       <term>Installation snapshots</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         Whenever one or more packages are installed with &yast; or &zypper;, a
         pair of snapshots is created: one before the installation starts
         (<quote>pre</quote>) and another one after the installation has finished
         (<quote>post</quote>). In case an important system component such as the
         kernel has been installed, the snapshot pair is marked as important
         (<literal>important=yes</literal>). Old snapshots are automatically
         deleted. By default the last ten important snapshots and the last ten
         <quote>regular</quote> (including administration snapshots) snapshots
         are kept. Installation snapshots are enabled by default.
        </para>

      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
       <term>Administration snapshots</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         Whenever you administrate the system with &yast;, a pair of snapshots is
         created: one when a &yast; module is started (<quote>pre</quote>) and
         another when the module is closed (<quote>post</quote>). Old snapshots
         are automatically deleted. By default, the last ten important snapshots
         and the last ten <quote>regular</quote> snapshots (including
         installation snapshots) are kept. Administration snapshots are enabled
         by default.
        </para>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
     </variablelist>
    <note>
      <para>Each of the three snapshot types (timeline, installation, administration)
        can be enabled or disabled independently.<!--For more information, see: Add

  <section xml:id="snapshot-types-time">
    <title>Snapshot types based on the time of creation</title>
    <para>
      &snapper; knows three different types of administration and installation
      snapshots: pre, post and single. These do not differ physically, but 
      &snapper; handles them differently.
