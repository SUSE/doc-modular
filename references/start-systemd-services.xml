    <title>Starting and stopping &systemd; services </title>

    <abstract>
      <para>
        You can start and stop &systemd; services by using units which are resources.
        These resources are defined using configuration file, called unit files. A unit is a
        resource that the system knows how to operate on and manage. The target units are service units,
        which have a <literal>.service</literal> suffix. For service management tasks, you do
        not have to add the <literal>.service </literal>because &systemd; knows that you want to execute a service.
