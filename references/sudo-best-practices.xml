      Learn about some of the best practices of &sudo; to control system access and at the same time enabling users to be productive.

        <term>Keep custom &sudo; configurations in separate files</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The main policy configuration file for &sudo; is
            <filename>/etc/sudoers</filename>. This file is supplied by the
            system packages and changes made to it may break updates. Therefore,
            create separate configuration files holding your custom settings
            under the<filename>/etc/sudoers.d/</filename> directory. These are
            pulled in by default by a directive in
            <filename>/etc/sudoers</filename>. For more information, refer to
            <xref linkend="sudo-edit-configuration-custom"/>.

        <term>Limit the &sudo; timeout</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            For security reasons you should not give unlimited access to
            &rootuser; privileges. Set a reasonable timeout instead to prevent
            misuse of the &rootuser; account by any intruder. For more
            information, refer to <xref linkend="sudo-change-pw-timeout"/>.

        <term>Manage users in groups rather than individually</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Keep your &sudo; configuration as lean and manageable as possible.
            Manage users by adding them to groups and then granting privileges
            to these groups rather than to the individuals. This allows you to
            add or remove users by simply adding changing the group settings
            instead of of having to look for the user's name all across your
            configuration.
          </para>
          <para>
            An example rule that allows all users in the
            <systemitem>%wheel</systemitem> group to execute all commands:
          </para>
          <screen>
%wheel ALL = (ALL) ALL
          </screen>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Stay away from overly permissive rules</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Rather than allowing everything to everyone, start with setting up
            permissions that are restrictive. If there is a user or a group of
            users who - for example - need to able to install software, but do
            not need to perform any other task that requires elevated
            privileges, let your settings reflect that. The following rule
            allows &exampleuser_plain; to use any kind of software installation
            utility on &productname;.
          </para>
          <screen>
&exampleuser_plain; ALL = (ALL) PASSWD : /usr/bin/zypper, /usr/bin/rpm, /usr/bin/yast /usr/bin/yast2
          </screen>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Restrict the path for binaries</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Restrict the areas where users can execute commands using the
            <literal>secure_path</literal> directive. The following example
            is the default setting that ships with &productname;.
          </para>
          <screen>
Defaults secure_path="/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin"
          </screen>
        </listitem>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Keep &sudo; logging transparent</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            &sudo; logs to the standard logfile where its log entries may easily
            get overlooked. Add the following rule to your configuration to
            specify a dedicated &sudo; logfile.
          </para>
          <screen>
Defaults logfile=/var/log/sudo.log
          </screen>
