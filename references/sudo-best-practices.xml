        <listitem>
          <para>
            To build a truly efficient and secure &sudo; configuration framework,
            establish a routine of regular testing and auditing.
            Identify possible loopholes and deal with them. Do not let convenience
            trump security.

        <listitem>
          <para>
            For security reasons, do not give unlimited access to
            &rootuser; privileges. Instead, set a reasonable timeout instead to prevent
            misuse of the &rootuser; account by any intruder. For more
            information, refer to <xref linkend="sudo-change-pw-timeout"/>.

          <para>
           Use the <command>visudo -f</command> command to safely edit the
           <filename>/usr/etc/sudoers</filename> file, because it checks the syntax of
           the file before saving the changes. This is a preventive way to
           correct any errors that can break the system.
           Besides the basic syntax check, you can also run
           <command>visudo -c</command> command to check whether your entire framework of
           &sudo; configuration is parsed in the right order and without an error.

        <term>Manage users in groups rather than individually</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Keep your &sudo; configuration as lean and manageable as possible.
            Manage users by adding them to groups and then granting privileges
            to these groups rather than to the individuals. This allows you to
            add or remove users by simply changing the group settings
            instead of having to look for the user across your configuration.
          </para>
          <para>
            An example rule that allows all users in an example
            <systemitem>%admingrp</systemitem> group to execute all commands:
          </para>
          <screen>
%admingrp ALL = (ALL) ALL
          </screen>
        </listitem>

      <!-- this is not useful with the current default config. Keep around in case that changes.
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Limit access to &sudo; users</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            A good practice is to configure &sudo; to enable users to execute specific commands as required.
            For example, if there is a user or a group of
            users who need to install software, but do
            not need to perform any other task that requires elevated
            privileges, let your settings reflect that. The following rule
            allows &exampleuser_plain; to use any kind of software installation
            utility on &productname;.
          </para>
          <screen>
&exampleuser_plain; ALL = (ALL) PASSWD : /usr/bin/zypper, /usr/bin/rpm, /usr/bin/yast /usr/bin/yast2
          </screen>

          <para>
            With the <literal>secure_path</literal> directive, restrict the
            areas where users can execute commands. The following example
            is the default setting that ships with &productname;.
          </para>

            &sudo; logs to the standard log file where its log entries may easily
            get overlooked. Add the following rule to your configuration to
            specify a dedicated &sudo; log file.
          </para>

Defaults logfile=/var/log/sudo.log
