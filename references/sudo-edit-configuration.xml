        The integrity of your system's &sudo; configuration is very important.
        Errors in these files can compromise your entire system. The
        <command>visudo</command> command provides a safe and secure way for
        an administrator to edit the &sudo; configuration.</para>

  <title>Separate custom configurations from the main &sudo; policy file</title>
    <para>
      The main policy configuration file for &sudo; is
      <filename>/usr/etc/sudoers</filename>. This file is supplied by the system
      packages, and changes made to it may break updates. Therefore, create
      separate configuration files holding your custom settings under the
      <filename>/etc/sudoers.d/</filename> directory. These are pulled in by
      default by a directive in <filename>/usr/etc/sudoers</filename>.
    </para>
  </tip>
  <para>
    Settings in the custom configuration files under the
    <filename>/etc/sudoers.d/</filename> directory always take precedence over the same
    settings made in the global configuration file
    <filename>/usr/etc/sudoers</filename>. The global configuration is read and
    applied first and the custom one after that.
  </para>
  <section xml:id="sudo-edit-configuration-visudo">
    <title>Editing &sudo; configuration files with <command>visudo</command></title>
    <para>
      While it is possible to edit &sudo; configuration files with any editing
      tool, it is best practice to use <command>visudo</command> for this task.
      <command>visudo</command> provides a basic set of safety measures to make
      sure you do not lock yourself out of your system due to a broken &sudo;
      configuration. It checks for parse errors, provides basic integrity
      checks and locks the configuration file against simultaneous edits,
      either by someone else or you in another session. If you tried editing a
      locked configuration file, <command>visudo</command> would tell you to
      try again later.
    </para>
    <para>
      By default, <command>visudo</command> uses <command>vi</command> as the
      underlying editor. To change this to, for example,
      <command>nano</command>, set the <systemitem>EDITOR</systemitem>
      environment variable:
    </para>
    <screen>
&prompt.sudo;EDITOR=/usr/bin/nano visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/<replaceable>NAME</replaceable>
    </screen>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="sudo-edit-configuration-custom">
    <title>Creating custom &sudo; configuration files</title>
    <para>
      To create a custom configuration file in the
      <filename>/etc/sudoers.d/</filename> directory, run
      <command>visudo</command> with the <option>-f</option> option and provide
      the name of your new configuration file:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.sudo;visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/<replaceable>01</replaceable>_<replaceable>custom_configuration</replaceable></screen>
    <para>
      When naming your custom configuration files, remember the following
      general rules:
    </para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Use descriptive file names</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Use file names that hint at what the configuration file does.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Do not use <option>~</option> and <option>.</option> in the file names</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            &sudo; interprets configuration file names containing
            <option>.</option> as provided or created by the package management
            rather than the system administrator and ignores them. The same
            applies to files that end in <option>~</option>. These are
            interpreted as being copies locked by an editing tool.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Make sure the configuration files are read in the correct order</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The order in which any custom files under
            <filename>/etc/sudoers.d/</filename> are parsed determines how
            directives are carried out. If you have set one directive in a file
            parsed early in the process and the same one in another file that is
            parsed later, &sudo; processes the last read version.
          </para>
          <para>
            To determine the order in which your custom configurations are
            read, add numbering to your configuration files and use a
            consistent number of leading zeroes. For example,
            <filename>01_myfirstconfig</filename> is parsed before
            <filename>10_myotherconfig</filename>.
          </para>

    <para>
      A basic syntax check is run when you edit a &sudo; configuration file. In
      this example, the edit introduced an error:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/01_test
[sudo] password for root:

Options are:
  (e)dit sudoers file again<co xml:id="co-edit"/>
  e(x)it without saving changes to sudoers file<co xml:id="co-exit"/>
  (Q)uit and save changes to sudoers file (DANGER!)<co xml:id="co-save"/>

        </para>
      </callout>
      <callout arearefs="co-exit">
        <para>
          Exit without applying the most recent change.

      </callout>
      <callout arearefs="co-save">
        <para>
          Apply the changes and exit. This results in a malfunctioning or broken
          &sudo; configuration.
        </para>
      </callout>
    </calloutlist>
    <para>
      To run a check of your entire &sudo; configuration, run:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;visudo -c
/etc/sudoers: parsed OK
/etc/sudoers.d/01_test: parsed OK
/etc/sudoers.d/02_test: parsed OK
/etc/sudoers.d/03_test: parsed OK
    </screen>
    <para>
      This tells you that all of your configuration files are syntactically
      correct and gives you the order in which the configurations
      are parsed. This information is needed in case you notice unexpected
      behavior of &sudo; which can simply be caused by directives being
      applied in the wrong order or overriding each other. If the configuration
      contains an error, <command>visudo</command> reports the file
      name, line number and error description of the affected file (see above).
