    <title>Custom configurations under <filename>/etc/sudoers.d/</filename> are 
    ignored</title>
    <para>
       The <option>#includedir</option> directive in
      <filename>/etc/sudoers</filename> ignores files that end with the
      <option>~</option> (tilde) character or contain the
     <option>.</option> (dot) character. This is to avoid issues with 
     configuration files provided by the package manager (containing 
     <option>.</option>) or with editor temporary or backup files (ending in 
     <option>~</option>). Make sure your custom configuration files neither 
     contain nor end in these characters and rename them, if they do.

    <title>Custom directives clash</title>

    <para>
      When a &sudo; configuration directive is applied is determined 
      by the order in which the respective configuration file is read. 
      Directives in a file located under <filename>/etc/sudoers.d/</filename> 
      take precedence over the same directives in 
      <filename>/etc/sudoers</filename>. If custom directives stated in 
      <filename>/etc/sudoers.de/</filename> do not work, check the order
       in which the files are read and fix it, if necessary.
    </para>
    <para>To check the order in which the configurations are parsed, use the 
    <command>visudo -c</command> command.</para>

    <title>Locked out due to broken &sudo; configuration</title>
    <para>
      When you have accidentally broken your system's &sudo; configuration and 
      locked yourself out from &sudo;, use <command>su -</command> and the 
      &root; pasword to start a root shell. Run <command>visudo -c</command> 
      to check for errors and then fix them using <command>visudo</command>.
