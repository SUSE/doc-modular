 <para>
        You can use the <command>systemctl</command> command to edit and modify an existing service file.

  <para>There are three main directories where unit files are stored on the system: </para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term><filename>/usr/lib/systemd/system/</filename></term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          When the RPM packages are installed, &systemd; unit files reside here.
         </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term><filename>/run/systemd/system/</filename></term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          &systemd; unit files created at run time. This directory takes precedence over the directory with installed service unit files.
        </para>
  </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term><filename>/etc/systemd/system/</filename></term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
         &systemd; unit files that are created by the <command>systemctl enable</command> command and also unit files added for extending a service.
         This directory takes precedence over the directory with unit files created at run time.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <para>The <command>sysctemctl edit </command> command by default opens a unit file snippet, for example:</para>
  <screen>&prompt.sudo; systemctl edit testhttp.service</screen>
  <para>This creates a blank file that is used to override or add directives to the unit file definition.
A directory is created in <filename>/etc/systemd/system</filename> which contains the name of the unit file
with <literal>.d</literal> appended. For example, a directory called <literal>testhttp.service.d</literal> is created.
  </para>
<para>Within the directory, a snippet called <literal>override.conf</literal> is created. &systemd; merges
    the override snippet with the full unit file, when the unit is loaded. This snippet's directives take precedence
    over those directives in the original unit file.
  </para>
  <para>You can edit the full unit file instead of creating a snippet with the <literal>--full</literal>flag. For example:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.sudo; systemctl edit --full testhttp.service</screen>
<para>This loads the current unit file into the editor, where you can modify. When you save and exit the editor,the modified
  file is written to <filename>/etc/systemd/system</filename>, which takes precedence over the system's unit definition usually located
  in <filename>/lib/systemd/system</filename>.
</para>
<para>To remove any additions you have made, you can either delete the unit's <literal>.d</literal> configuration directory or the
  the modified service file from <filename>/etc/systemd/system</filename>. After deleting the file or directory, reload the &systemd; process
  so that it reverts back to the initial system process.
</para>
