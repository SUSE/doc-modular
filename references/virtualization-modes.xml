    <abstract>
      <para>
        Virtualization is a technology that provides a way for a machine (&vmhost;) to run another
        operating system (&vmguest;) on top of the host operating system. There are two basic modes
        of hosting &vmguest;s on virtual machines&mdash;<emphasis>full virtualization</emphasis>
        mode and <emphasis>paravirtual</emphasis> mode.

      <term>Full virtualization (FV)</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          FV lets virtual machines run unmodified operating systems. It uses either Binary
          Translation or hardware-assisted virtualization technology, such as AMD* Virtualization
          or Intel* Virtualization Technology, to improve performance on processors that support
          it. In FV mode, &vmguest; is also called the <emphasis>Hardware Virtual
          Machine</emphasis> (HVM).
        </para>
        <tip>
          <para>
            Certain guest operating systems hosted in full virtualization mode can be configured to
            use drivers from the SUSE Virtual Machine Drivers Pack (VMDP) instead of drivers
            included in the operating system. Running virtual machine drivers improves performance
            on guest operating systems, such as Windows Server.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          PV normally requires that guest operating systems are modified for the virtualization
          environment. &vmguest;s running in paravirtual mode have better performance than those
          running under full virtualization. Operating systems currently modified to run in
          paravirtual mode are called <emphasis>paravirtualized</emphasis> operating systems and
          include &productnameshort;.

        <para>
          PVHVM enhances HVM (see <xref linkend="virtualization-mode-full"/>) with paravirtualized
          drivers, and handling of paravirtualized interrupts and timers.
