  <title>SSH login</title>
  <para>
    By default, &rootuser; SSH login in &productnameshort; is permitted only by using the SSH key.
    We recommend creating an unprivileged user during the deployment process that you can use to
    access the installed system. You can create an unprivileged user account on the first boot by
    using either the &combustion; or &ignition; tool. Creating an unprivileged user during system
    deployment is useful for accessing the &cockpit; Web interface as well.
