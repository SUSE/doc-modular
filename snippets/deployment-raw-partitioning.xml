  <para>
    Each image has the following subvolumes:
  </para>
<screen>
/home
/root
/opt
/srv
/usr/local
/var
</screen>
  <para>
    The <literal>/etc</literal> directory is mounted as overlayFS, where the
    upper directory is mounted to <filename>/var/lib/overlay/1/etc/</filename>.
  </para>
  <para>
    You can recognize the subvolumes mounted by default by the option
    <literal>x-initrd.mount</literal> in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>. Other
    subvolumes or partitions must be configured either by &ignition; or
    &combustion;.
  </para>
  <para>
    If you want to
        add a new user or modify any of the files on a subvolume that is not
        mounted by default, you need to declare such subvolume first so that it
        is mounted as well.
