  <title>Cluster restart required</title>
  <para>
    In this procedure, the script checks whether it is safe to restart the cluster services
    automatically. If any non-<literal>stonith</literal> resources are running, the script warns
    you to restart the cluster services manually. This allows you to put the cluster into
    maintenance mode first to avoid resource downtime. However, be aware that the resources will
    not have cluster protection while in maintenance mode.
