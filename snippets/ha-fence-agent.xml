  Each type of fencing device can be controlled by a specific <emphasis>fence agent</emphasis>,
  a <literal>stonith</literal>-class resource agent that acts as an interface between the cluster
  and the fencing device. Starting or stopping a fencing resource means registering or deregistering
  the fencing device with the <systemitem>pacemaker-fenced</systemitem> daemon and does not perform
  any operation on the device itself. Monitoring a fencing resource means logging in to the device
  to verify that it works.
