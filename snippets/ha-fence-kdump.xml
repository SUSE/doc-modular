  The <emphasis>stonith:fence_kdump</emphasis> resource agent checks if a node is performing
  a kernel dump (<systemitem>kdump</systemitem>). If a <systemitem>kdump</systemitem> is in
  progress, the cluster acts as if the node was fenced, because the node will reboot after the
  <systemitem>kdump</systemitem> is complete. If a <systemitem>kdump</systemitem> is not in
  progress, the next &stonith; device fences the node. This resource agent must be used together
  with a physical &stonith; device. It cannot be used with &sbd;.
