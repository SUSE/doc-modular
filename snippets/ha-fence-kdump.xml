  The <emphasis>fence_kdump</emphasis> agent checks if a node is performing a kernel dump
  (<systemitem>kdump</systemitem>). If a <systemitem>kdump</systemitem> is in progress,
  the cluster acts as if the node was fenced, because the node will reboot after the
  <systemitem>kdump</systemitem> is complete. If a <systemitem>kdump</systemitem> is not in
  progress, the next fencing device fences the node. This fence agent must be used together
  with a physical fencing device. It cannot be used with &sbd;.
