  In a <emphasis>split-brain scenario</emphasis>, cluster nodes are divided into two or more
  groups (or <emphasis>partitions</emphasis>) that do not know about each other. This might be
  because of a hardware or software failure, or a failed network connection, for example. A
  split-brain scenario can be resolved by <emphasis>fencing</emphasis> (resetting or powering off)
  one or more of the nodes. Node-level fencing prevents a failed node from accessing shared
  resources and prevents cluster resources from running on a node with an uncertain status.
