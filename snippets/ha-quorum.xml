  When communication fails between one or more nodes and the rest of the cluster (a
  <emphasis>split-brain scenario</emphasis>), a cluster <emphasis>partition</emphasis> occurs.
  The nodes can only communicate with other nodes in the same partition and are unaware of
  the separated nodes. A cluster partition has <emphasis>quorum</emphasis> (or is
  <quote>quorate</quote>) if it has the majority of nodes (or <quote>votes</quote>).
  This is determined by <emphasis>quorum calculation</emphasis>. Quorum must be calculated
  so the non-quorate nodes can be fenced.
