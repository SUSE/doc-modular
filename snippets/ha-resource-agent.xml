  In &sleha;, the <emphasis>cluster resource manager</emphasis> (CRM) is <emphasis>&pace;</emphasis>,
  which manages and coordinates all cluster services. &pace; uses <emphasis>resource agents</emphasis>
  (RAs) to start, stop and monitor resources. A resource agent abstracts the resource it manages and
  presents its status to the cluster. This means that &pace; only interacts with the resource agent,
  not with the actual application or service. &sleha; supports many different resource agents that
  are designed to manage specific types of resources.
