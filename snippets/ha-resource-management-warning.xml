  <title>Do not touch services managed by the cluster</title>
  <para>
     When managing a resource via the &ha; software, the resource must not be started or stopped otherwise (outside the cluster, for example manually or on boot or reboot). The &ha; software is responsible for all service start or stop actions.
     For interventions in resources that are currently managed by the cluster, set the resource to maintenance mode first.
