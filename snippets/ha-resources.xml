  In a &ha; cluster, the applications and services that need to be highly available are called
  <emphasis>resources</emphasis>. Cluster resources can include Web sites, e-mail servers,
  databases, file systems, virtual machines and any other server-based applications or services
  you want to make available to users at all times. You can start, stop, monitor and move resources
  as needed. You can also specify whether specific resources should run together on the same node,
  or start and stop in sequential order. If a cluster node fails, the resources running on it
  <emphasis>fail over</emphasis> (move) to another node instead of being lost.
