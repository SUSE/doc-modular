  &sbd; needs a watchdog on each node to ensure that misbehaving nodes are really stopped.
  &sbd; <quote>feeds</quote> the watchdog by regularly writing a service pulse to it. If &sbd;
  stops feeding the watchdog, the hardware enforces a system restart. This protects against
  failures of the &sbd; process itself, such as becoming stuck on an I/O error.
