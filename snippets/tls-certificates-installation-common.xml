    Install the signed certificate on the server that will use it. This
    typically involves configuring the server software &mdash;such as the
    Apache Web server&mdash;to use the certificate for securing
    communication. The certificate and private key are usually stored in
    files on the server.

    <emphasis role="bold">Install the certificate on the client.</emphasis>
    If necessary, install the signed certificate on client
    devices&mdash;such as Web browser&mdash;that communicate with the
    server. This step may not be required for all types of certificates,
    such as server-only certificates used for HTTPS.

    <emphasis role="bold">Configure the server and client for secure
    communication.</emphasis> After the certificate is installed on the
    server and client, configure the server and client software to use
    secure communication protocols, for example, HTTPS that utilize the
    certificate for encryption and authentication.
