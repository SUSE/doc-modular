        &productname; is a complex product consisting of multiple software
        layers and components. This document outlines the complete workflow for
        deploying and installing all &productname; dependencies, as well as
        &productname; itself. You can also find references to recommended
        hardware and software requirements, as well as steps to take after the
        product installation.

    <para>
      &productname; is being delivered as a set of components that you can
      combine to meet specific use cases. This provides extraordinary
      flexibility but means that there is not a single &helm; chart that
      installs the whole stack, for example, for using the &owui; chatbot style
      application. To enable the full integrated stack, you need to deploy
      multiple applications in sequence. Applications with the fewest
      dependencies must be installed first, followed by dependent applications
      once their required dependencies are in place within the cluster.

        By default, public endpoints such as &owui; are protected by self-signed
        SSL/TLS certificates. You also have the option to either have the
        certificate issued by a public Certification Authority (CA), or bring
        your own certificate (BYO). Except for the BYO case,
        <systemitem>cert-manager</systemitem> is required to facilitate the
        certificate management. Therefore, you must verify that the
        <systemitem>cert-manager</systemitem> <emphasis>custom resource
        definitions</emphasis> (CRDs) are installed using the
        <command>kubectl</command> utility, for example:
