    <para>
      In newer releases, remote access with a password over SSH or &cockpit; is disabled
      for &rootuser; but allowed for unprivileged users. If you have not done so already, create 
      an unprivileged user using the CLI or &cockpit;.

  <section xml:id="upgrading-micro-preparation-registration">
    <title>Register the machine</title>
    <para>
      On registration, the system receives repositories from the &scc; (see
      <link xlink:href="&sccurl;"/>) or a local registration proxy like &smt;.
      The repository names map to specific URIs in the customer center. To list
      all available repositories on your system, use <command>zypper</command>
      as follows:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;<command>zypper</command> repos -u</screen>
    <para>
      This gives you a list of all available repositories on your system. Each
      repository is listed by its alias, name and whether it is enabled and
      will be refreshed. The option <option>-u</option> also gives you the URI
      from where it originated.
    </para>

      To register your machine, run the <command>transactional-update</command>

      Upgrading the system is only supported from the most recent patch level.

  <section xml:id="upgrading-micro-preparation-backup">
    <title>Make a backup</title>
    <para>
      Before upgrading, back up your data by copying the existing configuration
      files to a separate medium (such as tape device or removable hard disk).
      This primarily applies to files stored in <filename>/etc</filename> and
      some directories and files in <filename>/var</filename> and
      <filename>/opt</filename>. You may also want to write the user data in
      <filename>/home</filename> (the <envar>HOME</envar> directories) to a
      backup medium.
    </para>
    <para>
      Back up all data as &rootuser;. Only &rootuser; has sufficient
      permissions for all local files.
    </para>
  </section>
  
  <section xml:id="upgrading-micro-preparation-disk-size">
    <title>Check disk size</title>
    <para>
      Software tends to grow from version to version. Therefore, take a look at
      the available partition space before updating. If you suspect you are
      running short of disk space, back up your data before increasing the
      available space by resizing partitions, for example. There is no general
      rule regarding how much space each partition should have. Space
      requirements depend on your particular partitioning profile and the
      software selected.
    </para>
    <para>
      On a Btrfs file system, the output of <command>df</command> can be
      misleading, because in addition to the space the raw data allocates, a
      Btrfs file system also allocates and uses space for metadata.
    </para>
    <para>
      Consequently, a Btrfs file system may report being out of space even
      though it seems that plenty of space is still available. In that case,
      all space allocated for the metadata is used up.
    </para>
    <para>
      Make sure there is enough free space as the root file system uses Btrfs
      and might consume a significant amount of space. Check the available
      space on all mounted partitions. In the worst case, an upgrade needs as
      much disk space as the current root file system (without
      <filename>/.snapshot</filename>) for a new snapshot.
    </para>
    <para>
      The following recommendations have been proven:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          For all file systems, including Btrfs, you need enough free disk
          space to download and install big RPMs. The space of old RPMs is only
          freed after new RPMs are installed.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          For Btrfs with snapshots, ensure you have at least as much free space
          as your current installation requires. We recommend having twice as
          much free space as the current installation.
        </para>
        <para>
          If you do not have enough free space, you can try to delete old
          snapshots with <command>snapper</command>:
        </para>
<screen>
&prompt.sudo;<command>snapper</command> list
&prompt.sudo;<command>snapper</command> delete NUMBER</screen>
        <para>
          However, this may not help in all cases. Before migration, most
          snapshots occupy only little space.
        </para>

  <section xml:id="upgrading-micro-preparation-shutdown">
    <title>Shut down virtual machine guests</title>
    <para>
      If your machine serves as a &vmhost; for &kvm;, make sure to properly
      shut down all running &vmguest;s prior to the update. Otherwise, you may
      not be able to access the guests after the update.
