    <title>Register the machine</title>
    
  <para>
    On registration, the system receives repositories from the &scc; (see
    <link xlink:href="&sccurl;"/>) or a local registration proxy like &smt;. The
    repository names map to specific URIs in the customer center. To list all
    available repositories on your system, use <command>zypper</command> as
    follows:
   </para>
 
 <screen>&prompt.root;<command>zypper</command> repos -u</screen>
 
   <para>
    This gives you a list of all available repositories on your system. Each
    repository is listed by its alias, name and whether it is enabled and will
    be refreshed. The option <option>-u</option> also gives you the URI from
    where it originated.

    <para>
      Before upgrading, back up your data by copying the existing configuration
      files to a separate medium (such as tape device, removable hard disk, etc.).
      This primarily applies to files stored in <filename>/etc</filename> and some
      directories and files in <filename>/var</filename> and
      <filename>/opt</filename>. You may also want to write the user data in
      <filename>/home</filename> (the <envar>HOME</envar> directories) to a backup
      medium.
     </para>
   
     <para>
      Back up all data as &rootuser;. Only &rootuser; has sufficient permissions
      for all local files.

      If your network service is wicked; you need to switch it to &nm; as wicked is not
      supported in the new release. To check which networking service you use, run:

       Even though &nm; and <command>wicked</command> are similar in functionalities, we cannot guarantee full feature parity. The conversion of the <command>wicked</command> configuration or automated switching to &nm; is not supported.  
      </para>
     
     <para>
      The <filename>/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*</filename> files are usually compatible except for some rare cases. But when you use the <command>wicked</command> configuration located in <filename>/etc/wicked/*.xml</filename>, you need to migrate the configuration manually.

  <section xml:id="upgrading-micro-preparation-disk-size">
    <title>Check disk size</title>
    <para>
      Software tends to grow from version to version. Therefore, take a look at
      the available partition space before updating. If you suspect you are
      running short of disk space, back up your data before increasing the
      available space by resizing partitions, for example. There is no general
      rule regarding how much space each partition should have. Space requirements
      depend on your particular partitioning profile and the software selected.
     </para>
     <para>
      On a Btrfs file system, the output of <command>df</command> can be
      misleading, because in addition to the space the raw data allocates, a
      Btrfs file system also allocates and uses space for metadata.
     </para>
     <para>
      Consequently a Btrfs file system may report being out of space even though
      it seems that plenty of space is still available. In that case, all space
      allocated for the metadata is used up. 
     </para>
     
     <para>
      Make sure there is enough free space as the root file system uses Btrfs and
      might consume significant amount of space. Check the available space on all
      mounted partitions. In the worst case, an upgrade needs as much disk space
      as the current root file system (without <filename>/.snapshot</filename>)
      for a new snapshot.
     </para>
     <para>
      The following recommendations have been proven:
     </para>
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        For all file systems, including Btrfs, you need enough free disk space to
        download and install big RPMs. The space of old RPMs is only freed after
        new RPMs are installed.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        For Btrfs with snapshots, you need as a minimum as much free space as
        your current installation takes. We recommend having twice as much free
        space as the current installation.
       </para>
       <para>
        If you do not have enough free space, you can try to delete old snapshots
        with <command>snapper</command>:
       </para>
  <screen>
&prompt.sudo;<command>snapper</command> list
&prompt.sudo;<command>snapper</command> delete NUMBER</screen>
       <para>
        However, this may not help in all cases. Before migration, most snapshots
        occupy only little space.

      If your machine serves as a &vmhost; for &kvm;, make sure to properly shut down all running &vmguest;s prior
