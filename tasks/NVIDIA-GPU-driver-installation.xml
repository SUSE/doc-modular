    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      This guide demonstrates how to implement host-level &nvidia; GPU support
      via the open-driver on &productname; &productnumber;. The open-driver is
      part of the core &productname; package repositories. Therefore, there is
      no need to compile it or download executable packages. This driver is
      built into the operating system rather than dynamically loaded by the
      &nvidia; GPU Operator. This configuration is desirable for customers that
      want to pre-build all artifacts required for deployment into the image,
      and where the dynamic selection of the driver version via &kube; is not a
      requirement.

      <title>Additional &nvidia; components</title>
      <para>
        Besides the &nvidia; open-driver provided by &suse; as part of
        &productname;, you might also need additional &nvidia; components. These
        could include OpenGL libraries, CUDA toolkits, command-line utilities
        such as <command>nvidia-smi</command>, and container-integration
        components such as nvidia-container-toolkit. Many of these components
        are not shipped by &suse; as they are proprietary &nvidia; software.
        This section describes how to configure additional repositories that
        give you access to these components and provides examples of using these
        tools to achieve a fully functional system.

    <section xml:id="nvidia-gpu-pre-install-version-mismatch">
      <title>Package version mismatch</title>
      <para>
        It is important to distinguish between &suse; and &nvidia; repositories.
        There can be a mismatch between the package versions that &nvidia; makes
        available versus what &suse; has built. This usually arises when &suse;
        makes a new version of the open-driver available, and it takes a couple
        of days before the equivalent packages are made available in &nvidia;
        repositories to match.
      </para>
      <para>
        We recommend ensuring that the selected driver version is compatible
        with your GPU and meets any specific CUDA requirements by checking:

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The driver version you plan to deploy has a matching version in the
            &nvidia; SLE15-SP6 repository. Ensure that you also have equivalent
            package versions available for the supporting components.

          From inside the container, you can continue to run any other CUDA
          workload&mdash;such as compilers&mdash;to run further tests. When
          done, you can exit from the container, noting that whatever you have
          installed in there will be lost and has not impacted the underlying
          operating system.
