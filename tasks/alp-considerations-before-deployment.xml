    This section introduces tips and suggestions that need to be considered

    <title>&rootuser; SSH login</title>
    <para>
      By default, &rootuser; SSH login in &productnameshort; is permitted only
      by using the SSH key. &rootuser; SSH login with password is prohibited.
      We recommend creating an unprivileged user that you can use to access the
      installed system and then enable &rootuser; SSH login.
    </para>
    <para condition="alp-deployment-agama-interactive">
      You can create an unprivileged user account during the installation
      process in the &alp-installer; environment.
    </para>
    <para condition="alp-deployment-rawdisk">
      You can create an unprivileged user account on the first boot by using
      the &ignition; tool.
    </para>
    <para condition="alp-deployment-all">
      Depending on the installation method, you can create an unprivileged user
      account either during the installation process in the &alp-installer;
      environment, or on the first boot by using the &ignition;/&combustion;
      tools.

        Creating an unprivileged user during system installation is useful for
        logging in to the &cockpit; Web interface. Find more details in
