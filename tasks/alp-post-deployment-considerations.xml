      <step>
        <para>
          Use the <command>qemu-img</command> command to increase the disk image to the desired
          size.
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          Set up the virtual machine and boot it. When the &jeosfirstboot; wizard asks you which
          method to use for encryption, select <guimenu>passphrase</guimenu>.

        <para>
          When the system is ready, use the <command>parted</command> command to resize the
          partition where the LUKS device resides (for example, partition number 3) to the desired
          size.
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          Run the <command>cryptsetup resize luks</command> command. When asked, enter the
          passphrase to resize the encrypted device.

      <step>
        <para>
          Run the <command>transactional-update shell</command> command to open a read-write shell
          in the current disk snapshot. Then resize the Btrfs file system to the desired size, for
          example:

      <title>Change encryption password</title>
      <para>
        During the &productnameshort; deployment, you entered a password that is used for disk
        encryption. To change the password, run the following command:
      </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;fdectl passwd</screen>

      <title>TPM device</title>
      <para>
        Without a TPM chip, you need to enter the encryption password to decrypt the disk on each
        &productnameshort; boot.
      </para>
      <para condition="alp-deployment-agama-interactive;alp-deployment-agama-automated">
        On systems that have a TPM 2.0 chip, &productnameshort; deployed with the &alp-installer;
        installer supports the automatic protection of the LUKS volume with a TPM device. The
        requirement is that the machine must use the &uefisecboot; enabled. If the &alp-installer;
        installer detects a TPM 2.0 chip and &uefisecboot;, it creates a secondary LUKS key. On the
        first boot, &productnameshort; uses the TPM to protect this key and configure the &grub;
        boot loader to unwrap the key automatically. Be aware that you must remove the ISO after
        the installer has finished and before the system boots for the first time. This is because
        we use the TPM to ensure that the system comes up with exactly the same configuration
        before unlocking the LUKS partition. This allows you to use the full disk encryption
        without having to type the disk password on each reboot. However, the disk password is
        still there and can be used for recovery. For example, after updating the &grub; boot
        loader or the SHIM loader, the TPM can no longer unseal the secondary key correctly, and
        &grub; has to fall back to the password.

    <para>
      Security-Enhanced Linux (&selnx;) is a security framework that increases system security by
      defining access controls for applications, processes and files on the file system.
    </para>
    <para>
      &productnameshort; ships with &selnx; enabled and set to the restrictive
      <emphasis>enforce</emphasis> mode for increased security. The enforce mode can lead to
      processes or workloads not behaving correctly because the default policy may be too strict.
      If you observe such unexpected issues, set &selnx; to the <emphasis>permissive</emphasis>
      mode that does not enforce &selnx; policies but still logs offenses against them called
      <emphasis>Access Vector Rules</emphasis> (AVCs).
    </para>
    <para>
      To set &selnx; to the permissive mode temporarily, run:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;setenforce 0</screen>
    <tip>
      <para>
        To set &selnx; to the permissive mode permanently, edit
        <filename>/etc/selinux/config</filename> and update it to include the following line:
      </para>
<screen>SELINUX=permissive</screen>
    </tip>
    <important>
      <para>
        If you entered an &selnx; permissive mode, you need to relabel your system until it is back
        in a good state. The reason is that the permissive mode allows you to reach states that are
        not reachable otherwise. To relabel the system, run the following command and reboot the
        system:
      </para>
<screen>
&prompt.root;touch /etc/selinux/.autorelabel
&prompt.root;reboot
</screen>
    </important>
    <para>
      To monitor AVCs, search the Audit log and &systemd; journal for log messages similar to the
      following one:
    </para>
<screen>
type=AVC msg=audit(1669971354.731:25): avc:  denied  { create } \
for pid=1264 comm="ModemManager" scontext=system_u:system_r:modemmanager_t:s0 \
tcontext=system_u:system_r:modemmanager_t:s0 tclass=qipcrtr_socket permissive=0
</screen>
    <para>
      To filter such messages, you can use the following commands:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;tail -f /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep -i AVC</screen>
    <para>
      and
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;journalctl -f | grep -i AVC</screen>
    <para>
      For more advanced search, use the following command:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;ausearch -m avc,user_avc,selinux_err -i</screen>
    <para>
      If such messages appear while using the application that did not behave correctly when
      &selnx; was set to the enforce mode, the policies are too restrictive and need updating. You
      can help to fine-tune &selnx; policies by creating a bug report at
      <link xlink:href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=SUSE%20ALP%20-%20SUSE%20Adaptable%20Linux%20Platform"/>.
      Specify <literal>Basesystem</literal> as a component, include the word
      <literal>&selnx;</literal> in the bug subject, and attach the gathered unique lines that
      include AVCs together with reproduction steps.
