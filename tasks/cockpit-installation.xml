      <para>
        Even though in most cases &cockpit; is present on &productnameshort; by
        default, there may be certain cases when &cockpit; is missing. This
        topic provides instructions on how to install it and enable its service.

  <para os="sles">
  &cockpit; can be installed during the system installation using &agama;, or you can install it
  later from the running system. To verify if &cockpit; is installed on your system, run:
  </para>
  <screen os="sles">&prompt.user; zypper se -i cockpit</screen>
  <para os="sles">
  If &cockpit; is not installed, proceed as described in <xref linkend="cockpit-installing-cockpit"/>.

      &cockpit; is included in the delivered pre-built images of the <literal>default</literal>
      type. In the <literal>base</literal> type of pre-built images, &cockpit; is not installed, so
      you have to install it as described in <xref linkend="cockpit-installing-cockpit"/>.

      If &cockpit; is not present on your system, you can install it by 
      following the procedure below:

    <procedure>
    <step os="sles">
    <para>
    Run the following command to install the &cockpit; pattern:

          Reboot your machine to switch to the latest snapshot.

      <step>
        <para>
          If the &cockpit; instance is intended to serve as a primary one, you
          need to enable the &cockpit; socket in &systemd; by running:
        </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo; systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket</screen>
        <para>
          After running the command, the server exposes the default
          <emphasis>9090</emphasis> port and &systemd; starts the
          <literal>cockpit-ws</literal> service that listens on the 9090 port.
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          In case you have enabled the firewall, proceed as follows:
        </para>
        <substeps>
          <step>
            <para>
              Open the firewall for &cockpit;
            </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;firewall-cmd --add-service=cockpit --permanent &amp;&amp; sudo firewall-cmd –reload</screen>
          </step>
          <step>
            <para>
              Restart <literal>cockpit.socket</literal> by running:

<screen>&prompt.sudo; zypper in -f cockpit-selinux-policies &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl restart cockpit.socket</screen>

          Now you can access the &cockpit; Web interface by opening the following

<para>
In the <literal>default</literal> type of images, &cockpit; contains a full 
set of plug-ins. However, depending on technologies installed on your 
system, some plug-ins may not be visible to you. For example,
if NFS is not present, the corresponding NFS panel is not visible.
