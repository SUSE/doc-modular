    &cockpit; is included in the delivered pre-built images by default, or can be installed
   if you are installing your own instances manually. For details regarding the
   manual installation, refer to the <link xlink:href="https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/html/SLE-Micro-all/cha-install.html#sec-settings-software">deployment guide</link>.

  <title>Installing &cockpit;</title>
  <para>
   Though &cockpit; is present in the pre-built images by default, the plugin for
   administration of virtual machines needs to be installed manually. You can
   do so by installing the <literal>microos-cockpit</literal> pattern as
   described below. You can also use the following command in case &cockpit; is not
   installed on your system.
  </para>
  <procedure>
    <step>
    <para>
     Install the pattern:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.root;<command>transactional-update pkg install -t pattern microos-cockpit</command></screen>
    <note>
   <title>Cockpit's plugins installed from the <literal>microos-cockpit</literal> pattern may differ according to technologies installed on your system</title>
   <para>
    The plugin <literal>Podman containers</literal> is installed only if the
    <emphasis>Containers Runtime for non-clustered systems</emphasis> patterns
    are installed on your system. Similarly, the <literal>Virtual
    Machines</literal> plugin is installed only if the <emphasis>KVM
    Virtualization Host</emphasis> pattern is installed on your system.
   </para>
  </note>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
   Reboot your machine to switch to the latest snapshot.
  </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
   If the &cockpit; instance is intended to serve as a primary one, you need to
   enable the &cockpit; socket in &systemd; by running:
  </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket</screen>
  <para>
   After running the command, the server will expose the default
   <emphasis>9090</emphasis> port. &systemd; will start the
   <literal>cockpit-ws</literal> service that listens on the 9090 port.
  </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
   In case you have enabled the firewall, proceed as follows:
  </para>
  <substeps>
    <step>
      <para>
        Open the firewall for
   &cockpit;
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.root;firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=cockpit</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Reload the firewall configuration by running:
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.root;firewall-cmd --reload</screen>
    </step>
  </substeps>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
   Now you can access the Cockpit web interface by opening the following
   address in your web browser:
  </para>
<screen>https://<replaceable>IP_ADDRESS_OF_MACHINE</replaceable>:9090</screen>
   </step>
