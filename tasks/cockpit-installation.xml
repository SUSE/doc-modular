        Even though in most cases &cockpit; is present on &productnameshort; by
        default, but there may be some cases when &cockpit; is missing. This
        topic provides instructions how to install it.

      &cockpit; is included in the delivered pre-built images by default, or
      can be installed if you are installing your own instances manually. For
      details regarding the manual installation, refer to the

    <title>Installing &cockpit;</title>
    <para>
      Though &cockpit; is present in the pre-built images by default, the
      plugin for administration of virtual machines needs to be installed
      manually. You can do so by installing the
      <literal>microos-cockpit</literal> pattern as described below. You can
      also use the following command in case &cockpit; is not installed on your
      system.
    </para>
    <procedure>
      <step>
        <para>
          Install the pattern:
        </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;<command>transactional-update pkg install -t pattern microos-cockpit</command></screen>
        <note>
          <title>Cockpit's plugins installed from the <literal>microos-cockpit</literal> pattern may differ according to technologies installed on your system</title>
          <para>
            The plugin <literal>Podman containers</literal> is installed only
            if the <emphasis>Containers Runtime for non-clustered
            systems</emphasis> patterns are installed on your system.
            Similarly, the <literal>Virtual Machines</literal> plugin is
            installed only if the <emphasis>KVM Virtualization Host</emphasis>
            pattern is installed on your system.
          </para>
        </note>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          Reboot your machine to switch to the latest snapshot.
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          If the &cockpit; instance is intended to serve as a primary one, you
          need to enable the &cockpit; socket in &systemd; by running:
        </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket</screen>
        <para>
          After running the command, the server will expose the default
          <emphasis>9090</emphasis> port. &systemd; will start the
          <literal>cockpit-ws</literal> service that listens on the 9090 port.
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          In case you have enabled the firewall, proceed as follows:
        </para>
        <substeps>
          <step>
            <para>
              Open the firewall for &cockpit;
            </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=cockpit</screen>
          </step>
          <step>
            <para>
              Reload the firewall configuration by running:
            </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;firewall-cmd --reload</screen>
          </step>
        </substeps>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          Now you can access the Cockpit web interface by opening the following
          address in your web browser:
        </para>
<screen>https://<replaceable>IP_ADDRESS_OF_MACHINE</replaceable>:9090</screen>
      </step>
