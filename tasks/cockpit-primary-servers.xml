    <abstract>
      <para>
        This topic focuses on logging in to servers that can expose the 9090
        ports.
      </para>
    </abstract>
  </info>
  <para>
    Whenever you have direct network access to the 9090 port, you can
    directly log in to the server using your credentials. To do so, follow
    <xref linkend="logging-into-primary-server"/>.
  </para>
  <note>
    <title>No dedicated credentials for &cockpit; needed</title>
    <para>
      By default, access is controlled by a &cockpit;-specific PAM stack
      located at <filename>/usr/lib/pam.d/cockpit</filename>. The default
      configuration allows logging in with the same user names and passwords
      that are used for any local account on the system.
