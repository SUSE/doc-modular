    <title>Logging in to secondary servers</title>

    <abstract>
      <para>
        If a server cannot expose the 9090 port, it can still be administered
        using &cockpit;. This topic provides information on logging in to such a
        server.
      </para>
    </abstract>
  </info>
  <para>
    If your machine does not have a direct access to the 9090 port, you can use
    this machine as a secondary server. Bear in mind that the machine needs to
    have &cockpit; installed.
  </para>
  <para>
    There are two ways of logging in to a secondary server: you can
    log in to a secondary server directly or you can use the primary server.
  </para>
  <section xml:id="cockpit-logging-into-secondary-directly">
    <title>Logging in to secondary servers directly</title>
    <para>
      You can log in to any secondary server without logging in to the primary
      server first. This solution can be useful when you do not have
      credentials for the primary server. The primary server will be used as a
      bridge, and you will be connected to the secondary server using SSH.
    </para>
    <para>
      To connect to the secondary server, proceed as follows:
    </para>
    <procedure>
      <step>
        <para>
          Go to the &cockpit; login page by opening the following address in a
          browser:
        </para>
<screen>https://<replaceable>IP_ADDRESS_OF_MACHINE</replaceable>:9090</screen>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          Fill in the credentials for the secondary server.

      <step>
        <para>
          Fill in the IP address of the secondary server.

          Proceed by clicking <guimenu>Login</guimenu>.

      <step>
        <para>
          If you are trying to log in for the first time, you are asked to
          verify the fingerprint. After this, click <guimenu>Accept and
          connect</guimenu>.

    <title>Accessing secondary servers from the primary server</title>
    <para>
      If you have credentials for the primary server, you can access secondary
      servers from the primary one. Bear in mind that you have to add the
      secondary servers first as described in
      <xref linkend="cockpit-logging-adding-secondary"/>.
