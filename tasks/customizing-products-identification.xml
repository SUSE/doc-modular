  Products based on &slea; support more than 7,000 software applications and
   the widest range of hardware platforms and architectures in the industry. Partnering with &suse;
   enables OEMs to build and deliver solutions that help customers reduce costs, manage complexity,
   and mitigate risk. However, when &slea; family products are being bundled with a
   system or integrated into a solution by an OEM, the system or solution needs to state the
   OEM status to customers, users and any compliance team. An important reason for this is that the
   terms and conditions of an OEM license agreement usually differ from a common end user
   license agreement (EULA).

   <para> To mark a system as containing an OEM version of a SUSE Linux Enterprise family
   product, follow the instructions detailed below. </para>

  <section xml:id="customizing-images-and-product-identification-os-release">
    <title>Modification of <filename>/etc/os-release</filename></title>
     <para>The file <filename>/etc/os-release</filename> is part of the <package>*-release</package>
    package for each product of the SUSE Linux Enterprise family. It is used to identify the
    respective product.</para>

   
     <para>If the OEM does not rebrand &slea; when integrating it into
     the OEM solution, the file <filename>/etc/os-release</filename> shall be amended. For details
     about the file structure, refer to the <link
     xlink:href="https://documentation.suse.com/sles/16.0/html/SLE-os-identification">&slea;

  <section xml:id="customizing-images-and-product-identification-issues">
    <title>Modification of <filename>/etc/issue</filename></title>
     <para>The file <filename>/etc/issue</filename> provides a banner to a system on login.
    As the default on &slea;, <filename>/etc/issue</filename> identifies the version,
    architecture, kernel and currently running network configuration of the respective
    product. An example follows.</para>
    <screen>
Welcome to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 16.0  (x86_64) - Kernel \r (\l).

eth0: \4{eth0} \6{eth0}
</screen>
<para>OEMs shall adjust <filename>/etc/issue</filename> to identify the OEM solution instead of
     SUSE Linux Enterprise. Find an example of a modified banner below:</para>

Welcome to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3  (x86_64) - Kernel \r (\l).

    <title>Completely rebranded systems</title>
    <para>An OEM can decide to completely rebrand a SUSE
    Linux Enterprise system. In this case, the OEM needs to create an individual
     <package>*-release</package> package including the <filename>/etc/issue</filename> and <filename>/etc/os-release</filename> files. The
     <package>*-release</package> package from the respective product provided by &suse; may be used
    as a template. </para>

   <para>It is important for the OEM to make sure <emphasis role="strong">no</emphasis> &suse;
    originated files can be found in <filename>/etc/products.d/</filename> that would identify the
    system as a &slea; system. Instead, the information contained in the file needs
    to come from the OEM and explicitly identify the OEM system.</para>
