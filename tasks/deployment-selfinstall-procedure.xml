    The following procedure describes how to deploy &productnameshort; using the selfinstallation ISO:
  </para>
  <procedure>
    <step>
      <para>
        Download the image.
      </para>
    </step>
       <step>
      <para>
        Boot your machine with the selfinstall ISO attached. 
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Select <phrase os="slemicro"><guimenu>Install SLE Micro</guimenu></phrase> to start the installation process.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Select the disk where &productnameshort; will be installed and confirm that you want to delete data on the disk. A &productnameshort; image is then copied to the disk.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Using <command>kexec</command>, your system reboots and is then prepared for the configuration process.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Start the configuration process by selecting
        <phrase os="slemicro"><guimenu>SLE Micro</guimenu></phrase>. If the configuration device is
        provided, &productnameshort; is configured according to the
        instructions provided on the configuration device. Otherwise &jeosfirstboot; is triggered
        as described in <xref linkend="deployment-jeos-firstboot"/>.
      </para>

        <title>Installation using the selfinstall ISO image does not create a boot EFI entry</title>
        <para>
          During the deployment of the selfinstall ISO, the image of the system is just copied to the selected disk, therefore, an EFI boot entry is not created (like it normally would if the system is deployed using an installer). You might need to manually boot your system using the EFI shell by selecting the &slema; boot loader. After the first boot, you can use <command>efibootmgr</command> to create the boot entry. <command>efibootmgr</command> is available by default in the deployed image.
        </para>
      </important>
      <para>
        After the configuration process is complete, you can log in to your system.
      </para>
    </step>
  </procedure>
