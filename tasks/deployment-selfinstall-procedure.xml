    <title>Dracut may not automatically assemble all disks</title>
    <para>
Dracut does not automatically assemble special devices like <literal>crypto_LUKS</literal>, <literal>dmraid</literal>, <literal>mdraid</literal> or LVM which
are found on the disk, but not configured explicitly in the system. These devices may come from
previous use of the disks. To enable auto-assembly, add <literal>rd.auto=1</literal> to kernel command-line.
For other command-line parameters controlling the auto-assembly of
individual types of special devices, refer to the <link xlink:href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/dracut.cmdline.7.html">dracut documentation</link>.

    The following procedure describes how to deploy &productnameshort; using
    the selfinstall ISO image:
  </para>
  <procedure>
    <step>
      <para>
        Download the image.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Boot your machine with the selfinstall ISO attached.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Select <guimenu>Install SL
        Micro</guimenu> to start the installation process.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Select the disk where &productnameshort; will be installed and confirm
        that you want to delete data on the disk. A &productnameshort; image is
        then copied to the disk.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Using &kexec;, your system reboots and is then prepared for the
        configuration process.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Start the configuration process by selecting
        <guimenu>SL Micro</guimenu>. If the
        configuration device is provided, &productnameshort; is configured
        according to the instructions provided on the configuration device.
        Otherwise &jeosfirstboot; is triggered as described in
        <xref linkend="deployment-jeos-firstboot"/>.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>      
      <para>
        After the configuration process is complete, you can log in to your
        system.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Perform post-deployment steps as described in <xref linkend="deployment-postdeploy-steps"/>.
      </para>
    </step>

  </procedure>

    <para>
To skip the prompt about the target device, you can use a custom image that enables you to pass
this target device using the
<literal>rd.kiwi.oem.installdevice</literal> option on the kernel command line. For details, refer
to the <link
