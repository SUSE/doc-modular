        The topic covers a simple example of a multi-container application.

  <para>
    To create a multi-container application, proceed as follows:
  </para>
  <procedure>
    <step>
      <para>
        Create the configuration file <filename>compose.yml</filename>. For
        details, refer to <xref linkend="docker-compose-yaml-reference"/>.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Prepare the required directory structure. We recommend placing the
        <filename>compose.yml</filename> file at the top of your working
        directory.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        If needed, write your own container files specific to services used by
        the containerized application. For exammple, to deploy a Go
        application, create a container file for the Go application with the
        required configuration and dependencies.
      </para>
      <para>
        We recommend creating a subdirectory per service in the working
        directory and placing the service-specific files there.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Deploy the multi-container application. For details, refer to
        <xref linkend="compose-creating-application-deployment"/>.
      </para>
    </step>
  </procedure>
