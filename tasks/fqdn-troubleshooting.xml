    <title>Troubleshooting FQDN</title>
</info>
<para>
  To ensure seamless connectivity and maintain SEO integrity, troubleshooting a malfunctioning FQDN requires a systematic approach to identifying resolution failures.

<para> Common troubleshooting steps include:</para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term><emphasis>Check the DNS records</emphasis></term>
      <listitem> <para>If your FQDN is not resolving, verifying your DNS records.A record maps your domain to an IP address. Ensure it points to the correct server.
      Check the CNAME record, which is used for aliasing one domain to another. Ensure it is not misconfigured or pointing to an inactive domain.</para>
</listitem>
 </varlistentry>
 <varlistentry>
  <term><emphasis>Check subdomain configuration</emphasis></term>
  <listitem> <para> When managing subdomains such as example.yourdomain.com, it is vital to ensure that each possesses its own accurately configured DNS records to prevent broken links and service interruptions.
    Neglecting these individual entries often results in inaccessible pages and a degraded user experience. However, implementing a wildcard DNS record (*.yourdomain.com) can serve as an efficient catch-all solution.
    This approach automatically routes traffic for any undefined subdomains to a central server, simplifying management as your network of hosted services expands.

  <term><emphasis>Secure FQDN with HTTPS</emphasis></term>
  <listitem> <para> Implementing SSL certificates to enable HTTPS is a critical necessity for any domain, as it secures sensitive user data through robust encryption. Beyond the essential security benefits, maintaining a valid certificate serves as a key SEO ranking factor within the Google search algorithm.</para>
