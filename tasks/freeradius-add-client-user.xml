        You can add client and user to test authentication for FreeRADIUS server. The client is a client of the RADIUS server, such as a wireless access point or switch. The users are added in the user configuration file and the clients are added in the client configuration file. These configuration files are stored on the server where FreeRADIUS is installed.
      </para>
      <para>The machines that can use the devices of the FreeRADIUS server are defined in <filename>client.conf</filename> file.</para>

  <procedure xml:id="add-client-user"><title>Configuring users and clients</title>
    <para>Add the machines that can use the devices of the FreeRADIUS server and the users by using the following example:</para>
    <step><para>Configure users in the authorization file, <filename>/etc/raddb/mods-config/files/authorize</filename>.</para>
    <para>To do this, open <filename>/etc/raddb/mods-config/files/authorize</filename> and uncomment the following lines:</para>
  <screen>bob   Cleartext-Password := "hello"

<para>Add clients of the RADIUS server, such as a wireless access point, network switch, or another form of NAS.</para>
<para>Create a client configuration on your server by using the following example.</para>
<para>Uncomment the following entry in <filename>/etc/raddb/client.conf</filename> and use the IP address of your test client machine or access gateway instead of the given IP address.</para>

<para>You must also configure the client to talk to the RADIUS server by using the IP address of the machine running the RADIUS server. The client must use the same secret as configured above in the client section.</para>
