    <para>Test the authentication for the newly added user using the following example:</para>
    <step>
      <para>Open a new terminal, and as an unprivileged user, use the <command>radtest</command> command to log in as the newly added user <literal>bob</literal>.</para>
      <screen>&prompt.user; radtest bob hello 127.0.0.1 0 testing123
        Sent Access-Request Id 241 from 0.0.0.0:35234 to 127.0.0.1:1812 length 73
                User-Name = "bob"
