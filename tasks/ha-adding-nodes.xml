    <title>Adding nodes with <command>crm cluster join</command></title>
    <meta name="maintainer" content="tahlia.richardson@suse.com" its:translate="no"/>
    <abstract>
      <para>
       Add more nodes to the cluster with the <command>crm cluster join</command> script.
       The script only needs access to an existing cluster node and completes the basic setup on
       the current machine automatically.
      </para>
    </abstract>
  </info>
  <para>
    For more information, run the <command>crm cluster join --help</command> command.
  </para>
  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Log in to this node as the same user you set up the first node with.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Start the bootstrap script:
    </para>
    <para>
     If you set up the first node as &rootuser;, you can run this command with
     no additional parameters:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;<command>crm cluster join</command></screen>
    <para>
     If you set up the first node as a <command>sudo</command> user, you must
     specify that user with the <option>-c</option> option:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;<command>sudo crm cluster join -c <replaceable>USER@NODE1</replaceable></command></screen>
    <para>
      If &chrony; is not configured to start at boot time, a message appears. The script also checks
      for a hardware watchdog device. You are warned if none is present.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
      If you did not already specify the first cluster node with <option>-c</option>, you are
      prompted for its IP address or host name.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
      If you did not already configure passwordless SSH access between both machines, you are
      prompted for the password of the first node.
    </para>
    <para>
      After logging in to the specified node, the script copies the &corosync; configuration,
      configures SSH and &csync;, brings the current machine online as a new cluster node, and
      starts the service needed for &hawk;.
    </para>
   </step>
  </procedure>
  <para>
    Repeat this procedure for each node. You can check the status of the cluster at any time with
    the <command>crm status</command> command.
  </para>
