    <title>Removing an &sbd; device</title>
    <meta name="maintainer" content="tahlia.richardson@suse.com" its:translate="no"/>
    <abstract>
      <para>
        Use this procedure to remove an &sbd; device from a cluster with multiple &sbd; devices configured. You cannot use this method if there is only one &sbd; device configured.

    <title>Cluster restart required</title>
    <para>
      In this procedure, the script checks whether it is safe to restart the cluster services
      automatically. If any non-&stonith; resources are running, the script warns you to restart
      the cluster services manually. This allows you to put the cluster into maintenance mode first
      to avoid resource downtime. However, be aware that the resources will not have cluster
      protection while in maintenance mode.

      <para>
        Disk-based &sbd; is configured with more than one device.
      </para>

  <para>
    Perform this procedure on only one node in the cluster:
  </para>
  <procedure>
    <step>
      <para>
        Log in either as the &rootuser; user or as a user with <command>sudo</command> privileges.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Check which devices are already configured for use with &sbd;:
      </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;<command>sudo crm sbd configure show sysconfig</command></screen>
      <para>
        The output shows multiple device IDs in the <literal>SBD_DEVICE</literal> line.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Remove a device from the &sbd; configuration:
      </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;<command>sudo crm sbd device remove /dev/disk/by-id/<replaceable>DEVICE_ID</replaceable></command></screen>
      <para>
        The script removes the device, updates the &sbd; configuration file, and checks whether it
        is safe to restart the cluster services automatically. If any non-&stonith; resources are
        running, the script warns you to restart the cluster services manually.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step><!-- Replace with snippet when available -->
      <para>
        If you need to restart the cluster services manually, follow these steps to avoid
        resource downtime:
      </para>
      <substeps>
        <step>
          <para>
            Put the cluster into maintenance mode:
          </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;<command>sudo crm maintenance on</command></screen>
          <para>
            In this state, the cluster stops monitoring all resources. This allows the services
            managed by the resources to keep running during the cluster restart. However, be aware
            that the resources will not have cluster protection while in maintenance mode.
          </para>
        </step>
        <step>
          <para>
            Restart the cluster services on all nodes:
          </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;<command>sudo crm cluster restart --all</command></screen>
        </step>
        <step>
          <para>
            Check the status of the cluster:
          </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;<command>sudo crm status</command></screen>
          <para>
            The nodes will have the status <literal>UNCLEAN (offline)</literal>, but will soon
            change to <literal>Online</literal>.
          </para>
        </step>
        <step>
          <para>
            When the nodes are back online, put the cluster back into normal operation:
          </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;<command>sudo crm maintenance off</command></screen>
        </step>
      </substeps>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Check the &sbd; configuration again:
      </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;<command>sudo crm sbd configure show sysconfig</command></screen>
      <para>
        The output should now show fewer devices.
      </para>
    </step>
  </procedure>
