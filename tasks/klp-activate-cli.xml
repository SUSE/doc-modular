  <para>
    &klp; is included in the standard &productnameshort; subscription. To use it, you need to
    install the following pattern:
  </para>
  
  <screen>&prompt.root;<command>zypper install -t pattern kernel_livepatching</command></screen>
     
    
  <para>
    At this point, the system has already been live-patched.
  </para>
  <para>
    Here is how the process works behind the scenes: when the package
    installation system detects that there is an installed kernel that can be
    live-patched, and that there is a live patch for it in the software
    channel, the system selects the live patch for installation. The kernel
    then receives the live patch fixes <emphasis>as part of the package
    installation</emphasis>. The kernel gets live-patched even before the
    product installation is complete.
