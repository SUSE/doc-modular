    <title>Checking expiration date of the live patch</title>
    <para>
      Make sure that the
      <package>lifecycle-data-sle-module-live-patching</package> is installed,
      then run the <command>zypper lifecycle</command> command. You should see
      expiration dates for live patches in the <literal>Package end of support
      if different from product</literal> section of the output.
    </para>
    <para>
      Every live patch receives updates for 13 months from the release of the
      underlying kernel package. The
      <link
    xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/products/live-patching/current-patches/">Maintained
      kernels, patch updates and lifecycle</link> page allows you to check
      expiration dates based on the running kernel version without installing
      the product extension.

    <title>Downgrading a kernel patch</title>
    <para>
      If you find the latest live patch problematic, you can downgrade the
      currently installed live patch back to its previous version. Keep in mind
      that a system with kernel warnings or kernel error traces in the system
      log may not be suitable for the patch downgrade procedure. If you are
      unsure whether the system meets the requirements for a patch downgrade,
      contact SUSE Technical Support for help.
    </para>
    <para>
      To downgrade the latest kernel live patch, use the <command>klp
      downgrade</command> command. This command automatically detects the
      version of the latest live patch and installs the preceding one.
