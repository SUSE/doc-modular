      <para>
        Log files under <filename>/var/log</filename> grow daily and quickly
        become very large. <command>logrotate</command> is a tool that helps
        you manage log files and their growth. It allows automatic rotation,
        removal, compression, and mailing of log files. Log files can be
        handled periodically (daily, weekly, or monthly) or when exceeding a
        particular size.

  <para>
    <command>logrotate</command> is usually run daily by &systemd;, and thus
    usually modifies log files only once a day. However, exceptions occur when
    a log file is modified because of its size, if <command>logrotate</command>
    is run multiple times a day, or if <option>--force</option> is enabled.
    View the <filename>/var/lib/misc/logrotate.status</filename> file to find
    out when a particular file was last rotated.
  </para>
  <para>
    <command>logrotate</command> can be configured to suit your needs. For
    details, refer to <xref linkend="logging-logrotate-configuration"/>.
