        The topic covers the deployment and post-deployment steps of
        &productnameshort; in public clouds.

  <para>
    The following procedure summarizes the deployment and post-deployment of
    the &productnameshort; image.
  </para>
  <procedure>
    <step>
      <para>
        Deploy the image to the public cloud. The specific procedure differs
        depending on particular cloud vendors. Refer to the particular
        documentation for details.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        The image comes with a default initial configuration that might not
        suit your needs. For example, you want to add another user on top of
        the default <emphasis>user</emphasis>. To change this configuration,
        proceed as described in
        <xref linkend="modifying-ignition-cnfiguration-cloud"/>.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Register the system as described in
        <xref linkend="micro-cloud-registration"/>.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        You may want to create different users from the running system. For a
        procedure of doing so, refer to
        <xref linkend="task-slemicro-useradd"/>.

    <title>Modifying the default configuration</title>
    <para>
      The default configuration is stored in
      <filename>/usr/lib/ignition/base.d/base.ign</filename> that is a part of
      the read-only file system. Therefore, direct changes to this file are not
      allowed. To modify this file, perform the following steps:
    </para>
    <procedure>
      <step>
        <para>
          Remove the flag file
          <filename>/boot/writable/firstboot_happened</filename>.
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          Run the following command:
        </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;<command>transactional-update shell</command></screen>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          Edit the <filename>/usr/lib/ignition/base.d/base.ign</filename> file
          to suit your needs. Here you can also add other users of the system,
          repartition the system and so on.
        </para>
        <para>
          The file is read by &ignition; during the next boot. &ignition;
          reconfigures the system according to the instructions in the file.
          For details about the &ignition; configuration, refer to
          <link xlink:href="https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/html/SLE-Micro-all/cha-images-ignition.html#sec-ignition-examples">&ignition;
          configuration examples</link>.
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          Exit the &tr-up; shell by entering <command>exit</command>.
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          As &ignition; runs in the <filename>initramfs</filename>, you need to
          rebuild it by running the command:
        </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;<command>transactional-update initrd</command></screen>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          To grant the newly created user access rights using the SSH key
          provided by the cloud framework, ensure that the following &systemd;
          service is started:
        </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;<command>systemctl start afterburn-sshkeys@<replaceable>USER_NAME</replaceable></command></screen>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          Reboot the system.
        </para>
      </step>
    </procedure>
    <note>
      <title>SSH keys handling</title>
      <para>
        Keep in mind that the SSH key that is used to start the
        &productnameshort; instance and passed using the instance metadata
        service will be set up for the default user <emphasis>suse</emphasis>.

      After you deploy the image, you need to register the system. In newer
      images, you can use the <command>registercloudguest</command> command to
      register the system. For details, refer to the
      <link xlink:href="https://documentation.suse.com/sle-public-cloud/all/html/public-cloud/cha-admin.html#sec-admin-register">Public
      Cloud Guide</link>.

      Alternatively, you can register your system as described in
