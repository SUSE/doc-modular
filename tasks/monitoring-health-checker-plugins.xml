    Health checker supports the addition of your own plugins to check services
    during the boot process. Each plugin is a bash script that must fulfill the
    following requirements:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Plugins are located within a specific
        directory&mdash;<filename>/usr/libexec/health-checker</filename>
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        The service to be checked by the particular plugin must be
        defined in the <literal>Unit</literal> section of the
        <filename>/usr/lib/systemd/system/health-checker.service</filename>
        file. For example, the <literal>etcd</literal> service is defined as
        follows:
      </para>
<screen>
[Unit]
...
After=etcd.service
...
</screen>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Each plugin must have functions called <literal>run.checks</literal>
        and <literal>stop_services</literal> defined. The
        <literal>run.checks</literal> function checks whether a particular
        service has started properly. Bear in mind that service that has not
        been enabled by systemd, should be ignored. The function
        <literal>stop_services</literal> is called to stop the particular
        service in case the service has not been started properly. You can use
        the plugin template for your reference.
