      <para>
      The &nm; daemon is a standard &systemd; service so you can use the
      <command>systemctl</command> command to manage the daemon.
        </para>
      </abstract>
  </info>  
  <para>
  You can use any of the following commands to manage the &nm; daemon:
  </para>
<!-- JH: Here I think it is better to list the commands than to provide a two-steps procedure and
then omit restart and the view status command itself.
Also the target network is fully sufficient as only NM is used for SLES and also if there
would be a different network management tool, only one would be active and the "network" would
apply anyway.

  <varlistentry>
  <term>Checking status</term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
  To check if the &nm; daemon is running and thus the network should be active:
  </para>
  <screen>&prompt.user;systemctl status network</screen>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Restarting the daemon</term>
<listitem>
<para>
For example, in cases of networking problem, you can try to restart the &nm; Daemon by using the
following command:
</para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;systemctl restart network</screen>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
  <term>Stopping the daemon</term>
  <listitem>
  <para>You can stop &nm; during network configuration changes or to switch to manual control. You
  can also stop the service for troubleshooting or debugging network issues. Stopping &nm;
  prevents it from automatically managing the interface or changing your manual 
  configuration. You can also stop &nm; to manually address specific requirements for
  network interfaces.</para>
  <para>
  To stop the &nm; daemon:
  </para>
  <screen>&prompt.sudo;systemctl stop network</screen>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
  <term>Starting the &nm; daemon</term>
  <listitem>
  <para>
  If you stopped the daemon, you need to start it again to manage all network connections:
  </para>
  <screen>&prompt.sudo;systemctl start NetworkManager</screen>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
