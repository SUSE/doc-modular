       The topic covers managing containers in a pod - adding new ones, starting and stopping
       alrady existing containers.
      </para>
    </abstract>
  </info>
  <para>
    To add a new container to a pod, use the <command>podman run</command>
    command with the option <literal>--pod</literal>. A general syntax of
    the command follows:
  </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;podman run <replaceable>[OPTIONS]</replaceable> --pod <replaceable>POD_NAME</replaceable> <replaceable>IMAGE</replaceable></screen>
  <para>
    For details about the <command>podman run</command> command, refer to
    <xref linkend="podman-running-containers"/>.
  </para>
  <note>
    <title>Only new containers can be added to a pod</title>
    <para>
      The <command>podman start</command> command does not allow for
      starting a container in a pod if the container was not added to the
      pod during the container's initial running.
    </para>
  </note>
  <para>
    You cannot remove a container from a pod and keep the container
    running, because the container itself is removed from the host.
  </para>
  <para>
    Other actions like start, restart, and stop can be performed on
    specific containers without affecting the status of the pod.
