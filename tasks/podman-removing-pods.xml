    There are two ways to remove pods. You can use the <command>podman pod
    rm</command> command to remove one or more pods. Alternatively, you can
    remove all stopped pods using the <command>podman pod prune</command>
    command.

  <para>
    To remove a pod or several pods, run the <command>podman pod
    rm</command> command as follows:
  </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;podman pod rm <replaceable>POD</replaceable></screen>
  <para>
    <replaceable>POD</replaceable> can be a pod name or a pod ID.
  </para>
  <para>
    To remove all currently stopped pods, use the <command>podman pod
    prune</command> command. Make sure that all stopped pods are intended
    to be removed before you run the <command>podman pod prune</command>
    command, otherwise you might remove pods that are still in use.
