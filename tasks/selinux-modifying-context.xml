       The topic covers changing of the security context type.

  <para>
    An important part of the work of an administrator is setting context
    types on files to ensure appropriate working of &selnx;.
   </para>
   <para>
    If a file is created within a specific directory, it inherits the
    context type of the parent directory by default. If, however, a file is
    moved from one location to another location, it retains the context type
    that it had in the old location.
   </para>
   <para>
    To set the context type for files, you can use the <command>semanage
    fcontext</command> command. With this command, you write the new context
    type to the policy, but it does not change the actual context type
    immediately! To apply the context types that are in the policy, you need
    to run the <command>restorecon</command> command afterward.
   </para>
   <para>
    The challenge when working with <command>semanage fcontext</command> is
    to find out which context you actually need. You can use
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;<command>semanage fcontext -l</command></screen>
   <para>
    to list all contexts in the policy, but it may be a bit hard
    to find out the actual context you need from that list as it is rather
    long (see
    <xref linkend="ex-selnx-semanage" xrefstyle="select:label quotedtitle nopage"/>).
