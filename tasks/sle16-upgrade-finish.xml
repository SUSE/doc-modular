        After the upgrade, you need to perform some additional tasks. The following section guides
        you through these steps.

      <para>
        A short introduction to the procedure.
      </para>
      <step>
        <para>
          Use <command>zypper packages</command> to check for orphaned and unneeded packages.
        </para>
        <substeps>
          <step>
            <para>
              Orphaned Packages are no longer available in any of the configured package
              repositories. They can no longer get updated and become unsupported.
            </para>
            <para>
              For a list of orphaned packages, run:
            </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;<command>zypper packages --orphaned</command></screen>
          </step>
          <step>
            <para>
              Unneeded packages are dependencies of packages that have been installed either
              explicitly by the user or implicitly as part a pattern or product, and that have been
              removed in the meantime. They are usually no longer needed and should be removed, too.
            </para>
            <para>
              For a list of unneeded packages, run:
            </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;<command>zypper packages --unneeded</command></screen>
            <tip>
              <para>
                To avoid unneeded packages, use <command>zypper rm</command> with the
                <option>--clean-deps</option> option.
             </para>
            </tip>
          </step>
          <step>
            <para>
              You can combine both lists into one:
            </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;<command>zypper packages --orphaned --unneeded</command></screen>
          </step>
          <step>
            <para>
              Use these lists to determine which packages are still needed and which can be safely
              removed.
            </para>
            <warning>
              <title>Do not remove packages you need</title>
              <para>
                If packages are renamed or removed from a pattern or product,
                <command>zypper</command> may no longer consider them explicitly installed and mark
                them as unneeded, even though they are still crucial for your installation.
              </para>
              <para>
                Carefully review the list of packages you are removing.
              </para>
            </warning>
            <para>
              To remove all orphaned and unneeded packages with a single command, run:
            </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;<command>zypper rm $(zypper --no-refresh packages --orphaned --unneeded | gawk '{print $5}' | tail -n +5)</command></screen>
            <para>
              Exclude a single package or pattern from being uninstalled:
            </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;<command>zypper rm $(zypper --no-refresh packages --orphaned --unneeded | gawk '{print $5}' | tail -n +5 | grep -v <replaceable>PACKAGE_TO_EXCLUDE</replaceable>)</command></screen>
            <para>
              Exclude multiple packages defined in a text file, separated by a newline:
            </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;<command>zypper rm $(zypper --no-refresh packages --orphaned --unneeded | gawk '{print $5}' | tail -n +5 | grep -v -f <replaceable>/PACKAGES/TO/KEEP.txt</replaceable>)</command></screen>
          </step>
        </substeps>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          Check for any <filename>*.rpmnew</filename> and <filename>*.rpmsave</filename> files. When
          an upgrade includes changes to a default configuration file that has been altered after
          package installation, instead of overwriting the file, one of these file types is
          created. While <filename>*.rpmnew</filename> contains the new default configuration and
          leaves your altered file untouched, <filename>*.rpmsave</filename> is a copy of your
          altered configuration that has been replaced by the new default file.
        </para>
        <para>
          If you find any of these files, examine their content and merge desirable changes. You do
          not need to search the whole file system, only the <filename>/etc</filename> directory.
          Use the following command:
        </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;<command>find /etc/ -name "*.rpmnew" -o -name "*.rpmsave"</command></screen>

      </step>   
      
    </procedure>
