          The system must be registered with the &scc; or an &rmt; server.
          &quot;Pay as you go&quot; instances in the public cloud are automatically registered
          to the SUSE-operated update infrastructure.

          The upgrade path must be supported. Currently, it is only possible to upgrade from 
          &productname; 15&nbsp;SP7 to 16.0. It is possible to configure other versions of
          &productname; as the migration target, but doing so is not a tested or supported use case.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
         The server that provides the migration target must have the appropriate repositories
         synced, and they must be up to date. This requirement is automatically met by the &scc;, and
         the &suse;-operated update infrastructure in the public cloud. If you are using an &rmt;
         server, make sure to mirror all relevant channels.

        <para>
          The operating system needs to reside on a single partition.
          Support for multiple partitions, such as LVM, is limited to configurations where the
          separated partitions do not contain OS-critical data or processes. For example, a separate
          <filename>/home</filename> partition will function whereas a separate
          <filename>/var</filename> will not.

      <title>SSH access during upgrade</title>
      <para>
        During the upgrade, it is only possible to log in via SSH key-based login.
        If your system is not configured for it, it is recommended that at least
        one of the users on the system has a <filename>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</filename> file with a
        private key accessible by the person executing the system upgrade.

      The distribution migration process can be invoked using two different methods. One method
      is the <command>run_migration</command> included with the <package>SLES16-Migration</package>
      package. The second method to invoking the migration process is via reboot after installing
      the <package>suse-migration-sle16-activation</package> package.
    </para>
    <para>
      Depending on your architecture, perform the following steps for your architecture to trigger
      the upgrade:

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Use <command>reboot</command> on &x86-64;, &aarch64;, &ppc64le;</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            After installing the <package>suse-migration-sle16-activation</package> package, start
            the migration process by rebooting the system:
            </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo; <command>zypper</command> in suse-migration-sle16-activation
&prompt.sudo; reboot</screen>
            <para>
              The <package>suse-migration-sle16-activation</package> package installs
              <package>SLES16-Migration</package> as a dependency and modifies the bootloader
              configuration to boot into the upgrade image.

        <listitem>
          <para>
            Modifying the boot loader configuration is not supported on s390x, so you start
            the migration directly with <command>run_migration</command>.
          </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo; <command>zypper</command> in SLES16-Migration
&prompt.sudo; <command>run_migration</command></screen>
          <para>
            The <command>run_migration</command> utility uses <command>&kexec;</command> and does 
            not work in &xen;-based environments. If <command>&kexec;</command> causes a kernel
            panic, refer to the TID at <link
             xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000019733"/> and set the
            <option>soft_reboot</option> customization option.
