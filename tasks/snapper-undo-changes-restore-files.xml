    <title>Using &snapper; to restore files</title>
   <meta name="maintainer" content="daria.vladykina@suse.com" its:translate="no"/>
    <abstract>
     <para>
     &snapper; provides the functionality to restore system files that may 
     have been accidentally deleted or modified, or to restore previous versions
     of files.</para>
    </abstract>
  </info> 
    <para>To use the restore feature, timeline snapshots for the root partition 
     must be activated. For more information about these backup snapshots, see <!--<link xlink:href="https://documentation.suse.com/smart/..."/>Snapshot types based on triggering events-->, 
     and about enabling them, see <!--<link xlink:href="https://documentation.suse.com/smart/..."/>Disabling/enabling snapshots-->. 
     You can also find out which modifications were made at a certain point 
     in time. To do so, use &snapper;'s diff feature.</para>
    <para>
     Being able to restore files is especially interesting for data that may
     reside on subvolumes or partitions for which snapshots are not taken by
     default. For example, to restore files from home directories, you need to 
     create a separate &snapper; configuration for <filename>/home</filename>
     doing automatic timeline snapshots. See
     <!--<xref linkend="sec-snapper-config"/>Creating and modifying Snapper configurations--> for instructions.
    </para>
    <warning>
     <title>Restoring files compared to rollback</title>
     <para>
      Snapshots taken from the root file system (defined by &snapper;'s root
      configuration) can be used to do a system rollback. The recommended way
      to do such a rollback is to boot from the snapshot and then perform the
      rollback. See <!--<xref linkend="sec-snapper-snapshot-boot"/>System rollback by booting from snapshots--> for details.
     </para>
     <para>
      Performing a rollback would also be possible by restoring all files from a
      root file system snapshot as described below. However, this is not
      recommended. You may restore single files, for example, a configuration
      file from the <systemitem>/etc</systemitem> directory, but not the
      complete list of files from the snapshot.
     </para>
     <para>
      This restriction only affects snapshots taken from the root file system.

  <warning>
    <title>Data consistency</title>
    <para>
     There is no mechanism to ensure data consistency when creating a snapshot.
     Whenever a file (for example, a database) is written at the same time as the
     snapshot is being created, it will result in a corrupted or partly written
     file. Restoring such a file will cause problems. Furthermore, certain system
     files, such as <filename>/etc/mtab</filename>, must never be restored.
     Therefore, we strongly recommend to <emphasis>always</emphasis> closely
     review the list of changed files and their diffs. Only restore files that
     really belong to the action you want to revert.
