        If you set up the root partition with <literal>Btrfs</literal> during the
        installation, Snapper&mdash;preconfigured for doing rollbacks of &yast; or
        &zypper; changes&mdash;will automatically be installed. Every time you start
        a &yast; module or a &zypper; transaction, two snapshots are created: a
        <quote>pre-snapshot</quote> capturing the state of the file system before
        the start of the module and a <quote>post-snapshot</quote> after the module
        has been finished.
      </para>

    <para>
      Using the &yast; Snapper module or the <command>snapper</command> command
      line tool, you can undo the changes made by &yast;/Zypper by restoring
      files from the <quote>pre-snapshot</quote>. Comparing two snapshots the
      tools also allow you to see which files have been changed. You can also
      display the differences between two versions of a file (diff).
