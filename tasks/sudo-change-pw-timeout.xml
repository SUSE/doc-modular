  <title>Changing the &sudo; password prompt time-out</title>
  <info>
    <meta name="maintainer" content="Julia Faltenbacher" its:translate="no"/>
    <abstract>
    <para>
    Learn how to change the time-out settings to execute commands that require
    root privileges without being prompted for the root password each time.
    </para>
    </abstract>
  </info>
  <para>
      When running a command prefaced with &sudo; for the first time, you are
      prompted for the root password. This password remains valid for a certain
      period of time before the &sudo; password prompt times out. To extend or
      shorten the time-out when executing commands that require root privileges,
      make the following changes to your &sudo; configuration file.
    </para>
    <procedure>
    <title>Changing the time-out for &sudo; password prompts</title>
      <step>
        <para>
          Create a new &sudo; configuration file for the timestamp configuration
          with:
        </para>
        <!-- jufa: check if this file is described in the sudoers concept and 
        link to it -->
        <screen>sudo visudo --f=/etc/sudoers.d/timestamp_timeout</screen>
        <para>
        After successful authentication with the root password, the file is
        opened.
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          Enable editing and add the line <code>timestamp_timeout=</code>.
          Enter a value for the timestamp.
        </para>
        <para>
          For example, to change the timeout to two minutes, enter:
        </para>
        <screen>timestamp_timeout=2</screen>
        <para>
        If the timestamp is set to zero, you will be prompted for the root
        password for every execution of a &sudo; command.</para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          Save the changes and close the file.
        </para>
      </step>
    </procedure>
    <para>
    You have created a &sudo; configuration file and changed the timeout
    setting to reduce the number of password prompts for &sudo; commands.
    </para>
