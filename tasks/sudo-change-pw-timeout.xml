    <title>Changing the &sudo; password prompt timeout</title>
    <abstract>
     <!--Remove later: Please do an editorial and structural review of this module, irrespective of
    whether you see much changes in this module-->
      <para>
        Learn how to change the timeout settings to execute commands that
        require &rootuser; privileges without being prompted for the &rootuser;
        password for each command.
      </para>
    </abstract>
  </info>
  <para>
    When running a command prefaced with &sudo; for the first time, you are
    prompted for the &rootuser; password. This password remains valid for a
    certain period. Once it is expired, the user is prompted for the password
    again.
    To extend or shorten the timeout when executing commands that require
    &rootuser; privileges, make the following changes to your &sudo;
    configuration file.
    It is important to know that the prompt for the &rootuser; password is for users who are not
    part of the <literal>wheel</literal> group.
  </para>
  <warning>
    <title>
      Do not grant unlimited passwordless access to &rootuser; privileges
    </title>
    <para>
      For security reasons, do not give unlimited access to &rootuser;
      privileges. Instead, set a reasonable timeout to prevent misuse of the
      &rootuser; account by any intruder.
    </para>

  <procedure>
    <title>Changing the timeout for &sudo; password prompts</title>
    <step>
      <para>
        As system administrator, create a new &sudo; configuration file for the
        timestamp configuration with:
      </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;<command>visudo --f=/etc/sudoers.d/timestamp_timeout</command></screen>
      <para>
        After successful authentication with the &rootuser; password, the file
        is opened.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Enable editing and add the line <code>timestamp_timeout=</code>. Enter
        a value for the timestamp.
      </para>
      <para>
        For example, to shorten the timeout to three minutes, enter:
      </para>
<screen>Dfaults timestamp_timeout=3</screen>
      <para>
        If the timestamp is set to zero, you are prompted for the &rootuser;
        password for every execution of a &sudo; command.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Save the changes and close the file.
      </para>
    </step>
  </procedure>
  <para>
    You have created a &sudo; configuration file and shortened the timeout
    setting for the execution of &sudo; commands.
  </para>
