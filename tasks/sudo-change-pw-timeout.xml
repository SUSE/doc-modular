    <title>Changing the &sudo; password prompt time-out</title>
    <abstract>
      <para>
        Learn how to change the time-out settings to execute commands that
        require &rootuser; privileges without being prompted for the &rootuser;
        password for each command.
      </para>
    </abstract>
  </info>
  <para>
    When running a command prefaced with &sudo; for the first time, you are
    prompted for the &rootuser; password. This password remains valid for a
    certain period. Once it is expired, the user is prompted for the password
    again.
    To extend or shorten the time-out when executing commands that require
    &rootuser; privileges, make the following changes to your &sudo;
    configuration file.
  </para>
  <note>
    <title>
      Do not grant unlimited passwordless access to &rootuser; privileges
    </title>
    <para>
      For security reasons you should not give unlimited access to &rootuser;
      privileges. Set a reasonable time-out instead to prevent misuse of the
      &rootuser; account by any intruder.
    </para>

  <procedure>
    <title>Changing the time-out for &sudo; password prompts</title>
    <step>
      <para>
        Create a new &sudo; configuration file for the timestamp configuration
        with:
      </para>
<screen>sudo visudo --f=/etc/sudoers.d/timestamp_timeout</screen>
      <para>
        After successful authentication with the &rootuser; password, the file
        is opened.
      </para>
      <para>
        For more information on how to edit the &sudo; configuration file,
        refer to <xref linkend="sudo-edit-configuration"></xref>.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Enable editing and add the line <code>timestamp_timeout=</code>. Enter
        a value for the timestamp.
      </para>
      <para>
        For example, to shorten the time-out to five minutes, enter:
      </para>
<screen>timestamp_timeout=5</screen>
      <para>
        If the timestamp is set to zero, you are be prompted for the &rootuser;
        password for every execution of a &sudo; command.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Save the changes and close the file.
      </para>
    </step>
  </procedure>
  <para>
    You have created a &sudo; configuration file and shortened the time-out
    setting for the execution of &sudo; commands.
  </para>
