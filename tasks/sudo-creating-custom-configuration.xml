    <title>&sudo; configuration best practices</title>
    <para>
      Before your start, here are a few ground rules for maintaining &sudo;
      configurations:
    </para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Always use the <command>visudo -f</command> command to edit the <filename>/etc/sudoers.d/</filename> directory</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Any changes to the &sudo; configuration should be done using the
            <command>visudo</command> command. <command>visudo</command> is a
            tailor-made tool that allows you to edit the &sudo; configuration
            files and runs basic syntax checks, making sure that the
            configuration remains intact and functional. A faulty &sudo;
            configuration can result in a user being locked out of their own system.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Always create custom configurations under <filename>/etc/sudoers.d/</filename></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Custom configurations must reside under the
            <filename>/etc/sudoers.d/</filename> directory to be pulled in by &sudo;.
            Settings in the custom configuration files take precedence over the
            ones in the default configuration in <filename>/usr/etc/sudoers</filename>.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Always mind the order in which configurations are read</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            To make sure the custom configurations are read in the correct order, prefix them with numbers.
            Use leading zeroes to establish the order in which the files are read. For example,
            <filename>01_myfirstconfig</filename> is parsed before
            <filename>10_myotherconfig</filename>. If a directive has been set
            in a file that is read before another file that contains
            conflicting information, the last-read directive is applied.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Always use descriptive file names</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Use file names that hint at what the configuration file does. This
            helps you keep track of what your &sudo; setup is supposed to do.

      <title>&sudo; configuration and immutable file systems</title>
      <para>
        An immutable file system is a file system that cannot be changed once it
        has been installed. It is accessed read-only. If the &suse; product you
        are using relies on an immutable file system, the &sudo; default
        configuration shipped with the product is installed under
        <filename>/usr/etc/sudoers</filename> and any pre-configured adjustments
        reside under <filename>/usr/etc/sudoers.d/</filename>.
      </para>
      <para>
        Your own custom configurations are located under
        <filename>/etc/sudoers.d/</filename> and take precedence over anything
        that is provided in <filename>/usr/etc/sudoers.d/</filename>. The
        <command>visudo</command> command opens <filename>/usr/etc/sudoers</filename>
        and saves the changed file to <filename>/etc/sudoers</filename>, if
        there was no prior <filename>sudoers</filename> file. If there was
        one already, <command>visudo</command> opens and writes that one. The
        instance located under <filename>/etc/</filename> takes precedence over
        the one that is kept under <filename>/usr/etc/</filename>. This way,
        user-made configuration adjustments will not get broken upon updates.
