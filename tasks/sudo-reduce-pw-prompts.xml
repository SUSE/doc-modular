    <para>
      When running a command prefaced with &sudo; for the first time, you are
      prompted for the root password. This password remains valid for a certain
      amount of time. The following article shows you, how to change the
      time-out settings for &sudo;.

    <title>Changing the time-out for &sudo; password prompts</title>
    <procedure>
      <para>
        To extend or shorten the time-out when executing commands that require
        root privileges, make the following changes in your &sudo; configuration
        file.
      </para>
      <step>
        <para>
          Create a new file for the timestamp configuration with:
        </para>
        <!-- jufa: check if this file is described in the sudoers concept -->
        <screen>sudo visudo --file=/etc/sudoers.d/timestamp_timeout</command>
        <para>
        After successful authentication with the root password, the file is
        opened.
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          Enable editing and add the line <code>timestamp_timeout=</code>.
          Enter a value for the timestamp.
        </para>
        <para>
          For example, to change the timeout to 2 minutes, enter:
        </para>
        <screen>timestamp_timeout=2</screen>
        <para>If the timestamp is set to zero, all &sudo; commands will ask for
        the root password.</para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          Save the changes and close the file.
        </para>
      </step>
    </procedure>
    <para>You have created a &sudo; configuration file and changed the timeout
    setting to reduce the number of password prompts for &sudo; commands.</para>
