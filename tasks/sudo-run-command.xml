    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      The execution of certain commands requires &rootuser; privileges.
      For security reasons, it is not recommended to log in as root. A safer
      approach is to log in as a regular user and run the command prefaced with
      &sudo;.

    Running a command prefaced with &sudo;
    </title>
    <para>
      As a regular user, you can run any command as &rootuser; by prefacing the
      command with &sudo;. After successful authentication with the &rooutuser;
      password, the command is executed with elevated privileges. The elevated
      privileges persist for a certain period of time, so you do not need to
      provide the &rootuser; password again when running another &sudo;.
    </para>
    <procedure>
      <para>
        The following example showcases how to execute a command prefaced with
        &sudo;.
      </para>
      <step>
        <para>
          To list all files contained in the root directory, enter the
          following command:
        </para>
        <screen>&prompt.user;<command>ls /root</command></screen>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          You are prompted to enter the &rootuser; password. Note, that the
          password is not shown during input, neither as clear text nor as
          masking characters.
        </para>
        <screen>[&sudo;] password for root:</screen>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          All files and subdirectories of <filename>/root</filename> are
          displayed:
        </para>
        <screen>bin dev home lib [...]</screen>
