    <title>Running a command prefaced with &sudo;</title>
    <abstract>
     <!--Remove later: Please do an editorial and structural review of this module, irrespective of
    whether you see much changes in this module-->
      <para>
        As a regular user, you can run any command as &rootuser; by adding
        &sudo; before it. This prompts you to provide the &rootuser; password.
        If authenticated successfully, this runs the command as &rootuser;.
       </para>
    </abstract>
  </info>
  <para>
    When running a command prefaced with &sudo;, the system asks you for the
    password of the &rootuser; account. After successful authentication, the
    command is executed with superuser privileges.
  </para>
  <para>
    Depending on the &sudo; configuration, the elevated privileges persist for a
    certain period of time and as long as you are working in the same terminal
    session. So you do not need to provide the &rootuser; password again when
    running another &sudo; command.
  </para>
  <procedure>
    <title>Running a command prefaced with &sudo;</title>
    <para>
      The following procedure describes how to use the &sudo; command to copy a
      file into a directory where only the &rootuser; user has editing rights.
    </para>
    <step>
      <para>
        Open a terminal and create a test file with:
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.user;<command>touch test.txt</command></screen>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Try to copy the file into the <filename>/usr/local/bin/</filename>
        directory with:
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.user;<command>cp test.txt /usr/local/bin</command></screen>
      <para>
        The terminal returns, for example:
      </para>
<screen>cp: cannot create regular file '/usr/local/bin/test.txt': Permission denied</screen>
      <para>
        This message also appears if the required privileges were not granted to
        &sudo;.
      </para>
</step>
    <step>
      <para>
       Now, enter the same command prefaced with &sudo;:
      </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;<command>cp test.txt /usr/local/bin</command></screen>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        You are prompted to enter the &rootuser; password. Note that the
        password is not shown during input, neither as clear text nor as
        masking characters.
      </para>
<screen>[sudo] password for root:</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        After successful authentication, the test file is copied to
        <filename>/usr/local/bin</filename>.
      </para>
      </step>
<result>
  <para>
    You have run your first &sudo; command.
  </para>
</result>
    </procedure>
