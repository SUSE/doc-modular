    <title>Running a command prefaced with &sudo;</title>
    <abstract>
      <para>
        On Linux, certain commands require elevated privileges. Learn how a
        regular user can run any command as &rootuser; by prefacing the command
        with &sudo;.

  <para>
    The execution of certain commands requires &rootuser; privileges. For
    security reasons, it is not recommended to log in as &rootuser;. A safer
    approach is to log in as a regular user and run the command prefaced with
    &sudo; to gain &rootuser; privileges.
  </para>
  <para>
    As a regular user, you can run any command as &rootuser; by prefacing the
    command with &sudo;. After successful authentication with the &rootuser;
    password, the command is executed with elevated privileges. The elevated
    privileges persist for a certain period of time, so you do not need to
    provide the &rootuser; password again when running another &sudo;. The
    following example shows how to execute a command prefaced with &sudo;.
  </para>
  <procedure>
    <title>Running a command prefaced with &sudo;</title>
    <step>
      <para>
        To show the content of the <filename>sudoers</filename> file, enter the
        following command:
      </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;&sudo; cat /etc/sudoers</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        You are prompted to enter the &rootuser; password. Note, that the
        password is not shown during input, neither as clear text nor as
        masking characters.
      </para>
<screen>password for root:</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        After successful authentication, the <filename>sudoers</filename> file
        is displayed.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you do not have the required &sudo; privileges or you run the
        command not prefaced with &sudo;, the following message returns:
      </para>
<screen>cat: /etc/sudoers: Permission denied</screen>
    </step>
  </procedure>
  <para>
    You have run your first &sudo; command.
