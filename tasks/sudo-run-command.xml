    <title>Running a command prefaced with &sudo;</title>
    <abstract>
     <!--Remove later: Please do an editorial and structural review of this module, irrespective of
    whether you see much changes in this module-->
      <para>
        On Linux, certain commands require elevated privileges. Learn how you, 
        as a normal user, can run a command as &rootuser; by prefacing it with
        &sudo;.
      </para>
    </abstract>
  </info>
  <para>
    When prefacing a command with &sudo;, the system will ask you for the
    password of the &rootuser; account. After sucessful authentication, the
    command is executed with elevated privileges.
  </para>
  <para>
    Depending on the &sudo; configuration, the elevated privileges persist for a
     certain period of time and as long as you are working in the same terminal
     session. So you do not need to provide the &rootuser; password again when
     running another &sudo; command.
  </para>
  <para>
    To start using sudo, use this syntax:
    <code>
      sudo [command]
    </code>
  </para>
  <para>
    The following procedure illustrates how to run a command with &sudo; to
    open the &yast; module in the terminal.
  </para>
  <procedure>
    <title>Running a command prefaced with &sudo;</title>
    <step>
      <para>
        Open a terminal.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        To see, what happens, if you run this command without &sudo;, enter the
        following command:
        <command>yast</command>
      </para>
      <para>
        The terminal returns for example:
      </para>
<screen>Absolute path to 'yast' is '/usr/sbin/yast', so running it may require superuser privileges (eg. root).</screen>
      <para>
        This message also appears if the required privileges were not granted to
        &sudo;.
      </para>
</step>
    <step>
      <para>
       Now, enter the same command prefaced with &sudo;:
        <command>sudo yast</command>
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        You are prompted to enter the &rootuser; password. Note that the
        password is not shown during input, either as clear text or as
        masking characters.
      </para>
<screen>password for root:</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        After successful authentication, &yast; is opened in the terminal.
      </para>
      </step>
<result>
  <para>
    You have run your first &sudo; command.
  </para>
</result>
    </procedure>
