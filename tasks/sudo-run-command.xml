    <title>Running a command prefaced with &sudo;</title>
    <abstract>
     <!--Remove later: Please do an editorial and structural review of this module, irrespective of
    whether you see much changes in this module-->
      <para>
        On Linux, certain commands require elevated privileges. Learn how you, 
        as a normal user, can run a command as &rootuser; by prefacing it with
        &sudo;.
      </para>
    </abstract>
  </info>
  <para>
    When running a command prefaced with &sudo;, the system asks you for the
    password of the &rootuser; account. After successful authentication, the
    command is executed with superuser privileges.
  </para>
  <para>
    Depending on the &sudo; configuration, the elevated privileges persist for a
     certain period of time and as long as you are working in the same terminal
     session. So you do not need to provide the &rootuser; password again when
     running another &sudo; command.
  </para>
  <para>
    The following procedure describes how to copy a file into a directory that
    can only be changed by &root;, by running the command with &sudo;.
  </para>
  <procedure>
    <title>Running a command prefaced with &sudo;</title>
    <para>
      As a regular user, you can run any command as &rootuser; by
      adding &sudo; before it. This prompts you to provide the &rootuser;
      password. If authenticated successfully, this runs the command as
      &rootuser;:
     </para>
    <step>
      <para>
        Open a terminal and create a test file with:
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.user;<command>touch text.txt</command></screen>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Try to copy the file into the <filename>usr/local/bin/</filename>
        directory with:
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.user;<command>cp test.txt /usr/local/bin</command></screen>
      <para>
        The terminal returns for example:
      </para>
<screen>Absolute path to 'yast' is '/usr/sbin/yast', so running it may require superuser privileges (eg. root).</screen>
      <para>
        This message also appears if the required privileges were not granted to
        &sudo;.
      </para>
</step>
    <step>
      <para>
       Now, enter the same command prefaced with &sudo;:
        <command>sudo yast</command>
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        You are prompted to enter the &rootuser; password. Note that the
        password is not shown during input, either as clear text or as
        masking characters.
      </para>
<screen>password for root:</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        After successful authentication, &yast; is opened in the terminal.
      </para>
      </step>
<result>
  <para>
    You have run your first &sudo; command.
  </para>
</result>
