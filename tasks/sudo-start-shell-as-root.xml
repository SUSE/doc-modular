    Start a shell with permanent root privileges by using the
    <command>sudo -s</command> or <command>sudo -i</command> command. With both
    commands, you are prompted for the root password only once.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      Having to enter &sudo; every time you want to run a command as root can
      become tedious. Instead, you can use one of the built-in mechanisms to
      start a shell with permanent root privileges. For this, there are two
      command options available:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
    <para>
    <command>sudo -s</command> launches the shell you have set as default shell.
    </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
    <para>
    <command>sudo -i</command> starts the login shell.
    </para>
    </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      With both commands, the shell is started with a new environment and 
      logged in as superuser. Any subsequent command that is executed within
      that shell is run with elevated privileges without having to enter the
      password again. When closing the shell, also this environment is
      terminated and you have to enter the password again if another &sudo;
      command is executed.
    </para>

  <section xml:id="task-sudo-start-shell-with-s">
    <title>Starting a shell with <command>sudo -s</command></title>
    <!-- jufa: seems to have impact on different directories also rethink
    if better to explain when to use which -->
    <!-- interactive shell run all commands as root, non-interactive, only run
    one command as root-->
    <para>
      The <command>sudo -s</command> command launches an interactive non-login
      shell. After successful authentication with the root password, all
      subsequent commands are executed with elevated privileges.
    </para>
    <para>
    Which shell is opened is specified by the <envar>SHELL</envar> environment
    variable or the user's default shell. In case this variable is empty, the
    shell defined in the <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> is picked up.
    </para>
    <para>
    To start a shell with permanently elevated privileges, enter the following
    command:
    </para>
<screen>
<prompt>&exampleuser_plain;:~ &gt; </prompt>sudo -s
root's password:
<prompt>root:/home/tux # </prompt>exit
<prompt>&exampleuser_plain;:~ &gt; </prompt>
</screen>
<para>
The prompt changes from &prompt.user; to &prompt.root;. 
</para>
<para>
You have started a shell with permanently elevated privileges. All
subsequent commands are executed without prompting for the password again.
</para>
  </section>
<section xml:id="task-sudo-start-shell-with-i">
    <title>Starting a shell with <command>sudo -i</command></title>
    <para>
      The <command>sudo -i</command> is similar to the
      <command>sudo -s</command> command-line option but launches an interactive
      login shell.
    </para>
    <para>
    To start a shell with permanently elevated privileges, enter the following
    command:
      </para>
<screen>
<prompt>&exampleuser_plain;:~ &gt; </prompt>sudo -i
root's password:
<prompt>root:~ # </prompt>exit
<prompt>&exampleuser_plain;:~ &gt; </prompt>
</screen>
      <para>
      You have started a shell with permanently elevated privileges. All
      subsequent commands are executed without prompting for the password again.
      </para>

        <title>Environment variables</title>
        <para>
          By default, &sudo; does not propagate environment variables. This
          behavior can be changed using the <literal>env_reset</literal> option.
