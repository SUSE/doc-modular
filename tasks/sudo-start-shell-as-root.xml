    <title>Starting a shell with &rootuser; privileges</title>
    <abstract>
     <!--Remove later: Please do an editorial and structural review of this module, irrespective of
    whether you see much changes in this module-->
      <para>
        Start a shell with permanent &rootuser; privileges by using the
        <command>sudo -s</command> or <command>sudo -i</command> command. With
        both commands, you are prompted for the &rootuser; password only once.
        It is important to know that if the user is part of the <literal>wheel</literal> group, they are prompted for
        their own password. Otherwise, they are prompted for the &rootuser; password.

    <title>Difference between <command>sudo -s</command> and <command>sudo -i</command></title>
    <para>
      Having to enter &sudo; every time you want to run a command as &rootuser;
      can become tedious. Instead, you can use one of the built-in mechanisms to
      start a shell with permanent &rootuser; privileges. For this, there are
      two command options available:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <command>sudo -s</command> launches the shell with the environment of
          the current user and offers a few privilege control measures. To run
          this command, enter the &rootuser; password.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <command>sudo -i</command> starts the shell as an interactive login
          shell with a clean environment. To run this command, you enter
          the &rootuser; password.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      With both commands, the shell is started with a new environment, and
      you are logged in as &rootuser;. Any subsequent command that is executed within
      that shell is run with elevated privileges without having to enter the
      password again. This environment is terminated when you close the shell,
      and you must enter the password again for another &sudo; command.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="task-sudo-start-shell-with-s">
    <title>Starting a shell with <command>sudo -s</command></title>
    <para>
      The <command>sudo -s</command> command launches an interactive non-login
      shell. After successful authentication with the &rootuser; password, all
      subsequent commands are executed with elevated privileges.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <envar>SHELL</envar> environment variable or the user's default shell
      specifies which shell opens. If this variable is empty, the shell
      defined in the <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> is picked up.
    </para>
    <para>
      By default, the <command>sudo -s</command> command runs from the
      directory of the previous user because the target user inherits the
      environment of the previous user. The command is also logged in your
      history.
    </para>
    <para>
      To start a shell with permanently elevated privileges, enter the
      following command:
    </para>
<screen>
<prompt>&exampleuser_plain;:~ &gt; </prompt><command>sudo -s</command>
[sudo] password for root:
<prompt>root:/home/tux # </prompt><command>exit</command>
<prompt>&exampleuser_plain;:~ &gt; </prompt>
</screen>
    <para>
      The prompt changes from &prompt.user; to &prompt.root;.
    </para>
    <para>
      You have started a shell with permanently elevated privileges. All
      subsequent commands are executed without prompting for the password
      again.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="task-sudo-start-shell-with-i">
    <title>Starting a shell with <command>sudo -i</command></title>
    <para>
      The <command>sudo -i</command> is similar to the <command>sudo
      -s</command> command-line option but launches an interactive login shell.
      When using the <command>sudo -s</command> command, the target user
      inherits the environment of the previous user. You can prevent it by
      using the <command>sudo -i</command> command, where the target user gets
      a clean environment and starts at their own <envar>$HOME</envar> directory.
    </para>
    <para>
      To run a command with <command>sudo -i</command>, enter the following:
    </para>
<screen>
<prompt>&exampleuser_plain;:~ &gt; </prompt><command>sudo -i</command>
[sudo] password for root:
<prompt>root:~ # </prompt><command>exit</command>
<prompt>&exampleuser_plain;:~ &gt; </prompt>
</screen>
    <para>
      You have started a shell with permanently elevated privileges, and the
      command is logged in your history. All subsequent commands are executed
      without prompting for the password again.
    </para>
    <!-- jufa: check content and if it makes sense here to be mentioned
      <tip>
      <title>Environment variables</title>
      <para>
      By default, &sudo; does not propagate environment variables. This
      behavior can be changed using the <literal>env_reset</literal> option.
      </para>
