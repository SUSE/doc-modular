    <title>Analyzing the security of &systemd; service units</title>

        &systemd; can apply additional restrictions to local services by using technologies
        included in the kernel. These restrictions are activated by adding specific options to the
        &systemd; service definition and restarting the service.

  <para>
    Use the <command>systemd-analyze security</command> command to analyze security settings of
    specified &systemd; service units. If unit names are not specified, the command inspects
    security settings of all currently loaded service units. We recommend running the command after
    a specific &systemd; unit file is updated. The command calculates an overall <quote>exposure
    level</quote> which is an estimation in the range 0.0 to 10.0, showing how exposed a service is
    security-wise. High values indicate little loose security provisions, while low exposure levels
    indicate tight security restrictions.
