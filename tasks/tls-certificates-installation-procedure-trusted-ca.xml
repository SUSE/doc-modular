      <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Generate a private key.</emphasis> A private key
        is required on the server&mdash;such as a Web server&mdash;that will use
        the certificate. The key is kept secure and used to sign messages and
        decrypt data.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Create a certificate signing request
        (CSR).</emphasis> Generate a CSR using the private key. The CSR contains
        information about the entity requesting the certificate and the public
        key that will be included in the certificate.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Submit the CSR to a CA.</emphasis> Submit the CSR
        to a CA for signing. The CA verifies the information in the CSR and
        issues a signed certificate if the request is approved. This step may
        involve validation of the domain ownership or organization identity,
        depending on the type of certificate requested.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Receive the signed certificate.</emphasis> After
        the CA approves the CSR, it issues a signed certificate. The certificate
        includes the digital signature of the CA, the public key of the server,
        and additional information about the server, such as the domain name or
        organization.
