       The topic describes how the snapshot cleanup algorithm works.

    <para>
      If you run the command <command>transactional-update cleanup</command>,
      all old snapshots without a cleanup algorithm will have one set. All
      important snapshots are also marked. The command also removes all
      unreferenced (and thus unused) <filename>/etc</filename> overlay
      directories in <filename>/var/lib/overlay</filename>.
    </para>
    <para>
      The snapshots with the set <literal>number</literal> cleanup algorithm
      will be deleted according to the rules configured in
      <filename>/etc/snapper/configs/root</filename> by the following
      parameters:
    </para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>NUMBER_MIN_AGE</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Defines the minimum age of a snapshot (in seconds) that can be
            automatically removed.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>NUMBER_LIMIT/NUMBER_LIMIT_IMPORTANT</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Defines the maximum count of stored snapshots. The cleaning
            algorithms delete snapshots above the specified maximum value,
            without taking into account the snapshot and file system space. The
            algorithms also delete snapshots above the minimum value until the
            limits for the snapshot and file system are reached.
          </para>

      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>
      The snapshot cleanup is also regularly performed by &systemd;.
