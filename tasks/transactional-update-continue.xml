    <title>Applying multiple changes using &tr-up; without reboot</title>

      <para>
        The &tr-up; command applies changes to the root file system on a
        transactional system.

  <para>
    The default &tr-up; behavior is to create a new snapshot from the current
    root file system after each change. To apply the changes you need to reboot
    the host. You cannot run the &tr-up; command multiple times without
    rebooting to add more changes to the snapshot, because this creates
    separate independent snapshots that do not include changes from the
    previous snapshots.
  </para>
  <para>
    Use the &tr-up; command together with th <option>--continue</option> option
    to make multiple changes without rebooting. A separate snapshot is created
    on each run that contains all changes from the previous snapshot plus your
    new changes. The final snapshot includes all changes. To apply them, reboot
    the system and your final snapshot becomes the new root file system.
