    <title>Working with unmanaged devices using &libvirt;</title>
    <meta name="maintainer" content="tbazant@suse.com" its:translate="no"/>
    <abstract>
      <para>
        &libvirt; is a unified interface to multiple virtualization solutions. &libvirt; virtual
        machines are typically managed by either &virsh;, a command-line utility, or &vmm;, an
        application with a graphical user interface. Assigning a &vmhost;'s PCI (or USB) devices to
        a &vmguest;&mdash;also known as &pciback;&mdash;dedicates the device's resources to the
        &vmguest;.
      </para>
    </abstract>
  </info>
  <para>
    When assigning a host device to a &vmguest;, you can specify whether the device is either
    <emphasis>managed</emphasis> or <emphasis>unmanaged</emphasis> by using the
    <literal>managed='yes'</literal> (default) or <literal>managed='no'</literal> option in the
    &libvirt; XML specification of the device, for example:
  </para>
<screen>&lt;hostdev mode='subsystem' type='pci' managed='yes'&gt;</screen>
  <para>
    <emphasis>Managed</emphasis> devices are automatically detached from the host driver and
    attached to the virtual <systemitem>vfio-pci</systemitem> driver of the guest during the domain
    startup. When the domain is terminated, the device is reattached to the original host driver.
  </para>
  <para>
    For <emphasis>unmanaged devices</emphasis>, you need to take care of detaching the device from
    the host and attaching it to the <systemitem>vfio-pci</systemitem> driver manually as suggested
    by the following steps:
  </para>
  <procedure>
    <step>
      <para>
        Before starting the domain, detach the device&mdash;for example, identified by
        <replaceable>pci_0000_03_07_0</replaceable>&mdash;from the host.
      </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;virsh nodedev-detach <replaceable>pci_0000_03_07_0</replaceable></screen>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Start the domain. It is automatically assigned the unmanaged device identified by
        <replaceable>pci_0000_03_07_0</replaceable>.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        After you stop the domain, you can make the device available to the host again.
      </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;virsh nodedev-reattach <replaceable>pci_0000_03_07_0</replaceable></screen>
    </step>
  </procedure>
