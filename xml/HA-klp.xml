    Kernel Live Patching (KLP) makes it possible to apply the latest security updates to
    Linux kernels without rebooting. This maximizes system uptime and
    availability, which is particularly important for mission-critical systems.
    As such, KLP offers several benefits.

        <para>
        Keeping a large number of servers automatically up-to-date is essential
        for organizations obtaining or maintaining certain compliance
        certifications. KLP can help achieve compliance, while reducing the
        need for maintenance windows.

      <para>
      The scope of <phrase><phrase os="sleha">SLE&#xA0;HA</phrase></phrase> Live Patching includes fixes for SUSE Common
      Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) level 7+ vulnerabilities and bug fixes related to system
      stability or data corruption. However, it may not be technically feasible
      to create live patches for all fixes that fall under the specified
      categories. SUSE therefore reserves the right to skip fixes in
      situations where creating a kernel live patch is not possible for
      technical reasons. Currently, over 95% of qualifying fixes are released
      as live patches. SUSE CVSS is based on the CVSS v3.0
      system. For more information on CVSS, see <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.first.org/cvss/">Common
      Vulnerability Scoring System SIG</link>.

      <title>Kernel Live Patching limitations</title>
      <para>
      KLP involves replacing functions and gracefully handling replacement
      of interdependent function sets. This is done by redirecting calls to old
      code to updated code in a different memory location. Changes in data
      structures make the situation more complicated, as the data remain in
      place and cannot be extended or reinterpreted. While there are techniques
      that allow indirect alteration of data structures, certain fixes cannot
      be converted to live patches. In this situation, a system restart is the
      only way to apply the fixes.

    <para>
    Kernel live patches are installed as part of regular system updates. Kernel
    live patches are delivered as packages with modified code that are separate
    from the main kernel package. The live patches are cumulative, so the latest
    patch contains all fixes from the previous ones for the kernel package. Each
    kernel live package is tied to the exact kernel revision for which it is
    issued. The live patch package version number increases with every addition
    of fixes. To determine the kernel patching status, use the
    <command>klp -v patches</command> command.
  </para>
    <para>
      Live patches contain only critical fixes, and they do not replace regular
      kernel updates that require a reboot. Consider live patches as temporary
      measures that protect the kernel until a proper kernel update and a
      reboot are performed.
  </para>
    <para>
      The diagram below illustrates the overall relationship between live
      patches and kernel updates. The list of CVEs and defect reports addressed
      by the currently active live patch can be viewed using the <command>klp
      -v patches</command> command.

    <para>
      It is possible to have multiple versions of the kernel package installed
      along with their live patches. These packages do not conflict. You can
      install updated kernel packages along with live patches for the running
      kernel. In this case, you may be prompted to reboot the system. Users
      with <phrase><phrase os="sleha">SLE&#xA0;HA</phrase></phrase> Live Patching subscriptions are eligible for technical
      support as long as there are live patch updates for the running kernel.
    </para>
    <para>
      With KLP activated, every kernel update comes with a live patch
      package. This live patch does not contain any fixes and serves as a seed
      for future live patches for the corresponding kernel. These empty seed
      patches are called <literal>initial patches</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Keep in mind that while there may be multiple kernel packages installed on
      the system, only one of them is running at any given time. Similarly,
      there may be multiple live patch packages installed, but only one live
      patch is loaded into the kernel.
     </para>
    <para>
      The active live patch is included in the <literal>initrd</literal>. This
      means that in case of an unexpected reboot, the system comes up with the
      live patch fixes applied, so there is no need to perform patching again.

    Kernel Live Patching is included in the standard <phrase><phrase os="sleha">SLE&#xA0;HA</phrase></phrase> subscription. To use it, you need to
    install the following pattern:

    <screen>
      <prompt role="root"># </prompt>
      <command>zypper install -t pattern lp_sles</command>
    </screen>
    <para>
    At this point, the system has already been live-patched.
  </para>
    <para>
    Here is how the process works behind the scenes: when the package
    installation system detects that there is an installed kernel that can be
    live-patched, and that there is a live patch for it in the software
    channel, the system selects the live patch for installation. The kernel
    then receives the live patch fixes <emphasis>as part of the package
    installation</emphasis>. The kernel gets live-patched even before the
    product installation is complete.

  matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
  subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
  Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be
  a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters,
  or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
  regarding them.
 </para>
    <para>
  The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
  designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
  that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit
  the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as
  Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document
  does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
 </para>
    <para>
  The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
  Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
  Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5
  words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
 </para>
    <para>
  A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
  represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
  public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with
  generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint
  programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is
  suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
  variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an
  otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
  been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is
  not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any
  substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
  "Opaque".
 </para>
    <para>
  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
  without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
  publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or
  PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats
  include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can
  be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
  the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
  machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors
  for output purposes only.
 </para>
    <para>
  The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
  following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
  requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
  any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
  appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
  text.
 </para>
    <para>
  A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title
  either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that
  translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section
  name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
  "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when
  you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ"
  according to this definition.
 </para>
    <para>
  The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states
  that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are
  considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards
  disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers
  may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.
 </para>
    <bridgehead renderas="sect4">
    2. VERBATIM COPYING
  </bridgehead>
    <para>
  You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
  or non-commercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and
  the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced
  in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of
  this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
  reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you
  may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large
  enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
 </para>
    <para>
  You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may
  publicly display copies.
 </para>
    <bridgehead renderas="sect4">
    3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
  </bridgehead>
    <para>
  If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed
  covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license
  notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that
  carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the
  front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also
  clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front
  cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
  prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the
  title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as
  verbatim copying in other respects.
 </para>
    <para>
  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
  should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
  cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
 </para>
    <para>
  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
  than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
  with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
  computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
  access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
  Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
  latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
  distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
  copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
  year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through
  your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
 </para>
    <para>
  It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
  Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them
  a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
 </para>
    <bridgehead renderas="sect4">
    4. MODIFICATIONS
  </bridgehead>
    <para>
  You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
  conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
  Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
  role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
  Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
  these things in the Modified Version:

    use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that
    version gives permission.

  If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that
  qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
  Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
  invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in
  the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any
  other section titles.
 </para>
    <para>
  You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
  but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
  statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
  organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
 </para>
    <para>
  You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
  passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
  Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and
  one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any
  one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
  previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are
  acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
  one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old
  one.
 </para>
    <para>
  The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
  permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
  endorsement of any Modified Version.
 </para>
    <bridgehead renderas="sect4">
    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
  </bridgehead>
    <para>
  You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
  License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
  provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of
  all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
  Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve
  all their Warranty Disclaimers.
 </para>
    <para>
  The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
  identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
  multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make
  the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
  parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if
  known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
  titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
  combined work.
 </para>
    <para>
  In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the
  various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise
  combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled
  "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".
 </para>
    <bridgehead renderas="sect4">
    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
  </bridgehead>
    <para>
  You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
  released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
  License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the
  collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim
  copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
 </para>
    <para>
  You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
  individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
  into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
  regarding verbatim copying of that document.
 </para>
    <bridgehead renderas="sect4">
    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
  </bridgehead>
    <para>
  A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
  independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
  distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from
  the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's
  users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included
  in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the
  aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
 </para>
    <para>
  If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
  the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
  aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket
  the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if
  the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed
  covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
 </para>
    <bridgehead renderas="sect4">
    8. TRANSLATION
  </bridgehead>
    <para>
  Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
  translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
  Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their
  copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant
  Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
  You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in
  the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
  the original English version of this License and the original versions of
  those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
  translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
  disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
 </para>
    <para>
  If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
  or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1)
  will typically require changing the actual title.
 </para>
    <bridgehead renderas="sect4">
    9. TERMINATION
  </bridgehead>
    <para>
  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
  expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
  sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically
  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
  copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
  </bridgehead>
    <para>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
  Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
  similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address

  later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has
  been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
  Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
  any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
