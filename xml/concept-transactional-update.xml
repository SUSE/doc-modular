    <title>What are transactional updates?</title>
    <para>
      To keep the base operating system stable and consistent, the &productname;
      (&productnameshort;) uses a read-only root file system. Therefore, you cannot
      perform direct changes to the root file system, for example, by using the
      <command>zypper</command> command. Instead, &productnameshort; introduces
      <emphasis>transactional updates</emphasis> that allow you to apply one or
      more changes to the root file system.
    </para>

  <section xml:id="how-it-works-transactional-update">
    <title>How do transactional updates work?</title>
    <para>
      Each time you call the &tr-up; command to change your system&mdash;either
      to install a package, perform an update or apply a patch&mdash;the
      following actions take place:
    </para>
    <procedure>
      <title>Modifying the root file system</title>
      <step>
        <para>
          A new read-write snapshot is created from your current root file
          system, or from a snapshot that you specified.
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          All changes are applied (updates, patches or package installation).
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          The snapshot is switched back to read-only mode.
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          If the changes were applied successfully, the new root file system
          snapshot is set as default.
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          After rebooting, the system boots into the new snapshot.
        </para>
      </step>
    </procedure>
    <tip>
      <title>Multiple changes to the root file system without reboots</title>
      <para>
        Normally, each transactional update requires the system reboot before
        the changes are applied. If you want to perform multiple transactional
        updates in one snapshot, use the <option>--continue</option> option.
        This way you will need to reboot the system only once after you perform
        all the required updates.
      </para>
    </tip>

  <section xml:id="how-it-works-transactional-update-etc">
    <title><filename>/etc</filename> on a read-only file system</title>
    <para>
      Even though <filename>/etc</filename> is part of the read-only file
      system, using an <literal>OverlayFS</literal> layer on this directory
      enables you to write to this directory. All modifications that you
      performed on the content of <filename>/etc</filename> are written to the
      <filename>/var/lib/overlay/<replaceable>SNAPSHOT_NUMBER</replaceable>/etc</filename>.
      Each snapshot has one associated <literal>OverlayFS</literal> directory.
    </para>
    <para>
      Whenever a new snapshot is created (for example, as a result of a system
      update), the content of <filename>/etc</filename> is synchronized and
      used as a base in the new snapshot. In the <literal>OverlayFS</literal>
      terminology, the current snapshot's <filename>/etc</filename> is mounted
      as <literal>lowerdir</literal>. The new snapshot's
      <filename>/etc</filename> is mounted as <literal>upperdir</literal>. If
      there were no changes in the <literal>upperdir</literal>
      <filename>/etc</filename>, any changes performed to the
      <literal>lowerdir</literal> are visible to the
      <literal>upperdir</literal>. Therefore, the new snapshot also contains
      the changes from the current snapshot's <filename>/etc</filename>.
    </para>
    <important>
      <title>Concurrent modification of <literal>lowerdir</literal> and <literal>upperdir</literal></title>
      <para>
        If <filename>/etc</filename> in both snapshots is modified, only the
        changes in the new snapshot (<literal>upperdir</literal>) persist.
        Changes made to the current snapshot (<literal>lowerdir</literal>) are
        not synchronized to the new snapshot. Therefore, we do not recommend
        changing <filename>/etc</filename> after a new snapshot has been
        created and the system has not been rebooted. However, you can still
        find the changes in the <filename>/var/lib/overlay/</filename>
        directory for the snapshot in which the changes were performed.
      </para>
    </important>
    <note>
      <title>Using the <literal>--continue</literal> option of the <command>transactional-update</command> command</title>
      <para>
        When using the <option>--continue</option> option and the new snapshot
        is a descendant of the current snapshot, then the
        <filename>/etc</filename> overlays of all the snapshots in between will
        be added as additional directories to the <filename>lowerdir</filename>
        (the <filename>lowerdir</filename> can have several mount points).
