    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      This article includes important information and tasks that you need to
      consider after you successfully deploy the &alp; (&alpshort;).
    </para>

    <title>Full disk encryption</title>
    <section xml:id="alp-post-deploy-full-disk-encryption-password">
      <title>Change encryption password</title>
      <para>
        During the &alpshort; deployment, you entered a password that is used
        for disk encryption. If you want to change the password, run the
        following command:
      </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;fdectl passwd</screen>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="alp-post-deploy-full-disk-encryption-tpm">
      <title>TPM device</title>
      <para>
        Without a TPM chip, you need to enter the encryption password to
        decrypt the disk on each &alpshort; boot. On systems that have a TPM
        2.0 chip, &alpshort; deployed with &dinstaller; supports the automatic
        protection of the LUKS volume with a TPM device. The requirement is
        that the machine must use the &uefisecboot; enabled.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the &dinstaller; detects a TPM 2.0 chip and &uefisecboot;, it will
        create a secondary LUKS key. On the first boot, &alpshort; will use the
        TPM to protect this key and configure the &grub; boot loader to
        automatically unwrap the key. Be aware that you must remove the ISO
        after the installer has finished and before the system boots for the
        first time. This is because we use the TPM to ensure that the system
        comes up with exactly the same configuration before unlocking the LUKS
        partition.
      </para>
      <para>
        This allows you to use the full disk encryption without having to type
        the disk password on each reboot. However, the disk password is still
        there and can be used for recovery. For example, after updating the
        &grub; boot loader, or the SHIM loader, the TPM will no longer be able
        to unseal the secondary key correctly, and &grub; will have to fall
        back to the password.
      </para>

    <title>&selnx;</title>
    <para>
      Security-Enhanced Linux (&selnx;) is a security framework that increases
      system security by defining access controls for applications, processes
      and files on the file system.
    </para>
    <para>
      &alpshort; ships with &selnx; enabled and set to the restrictive
      <emphasis>enforce</emphasis> mode for increased security. The enforce
      mode can lead to processes or workloads not behaving correctly because
      the default policy may be too strict. If you observe such unexpected
      issues, set &selnx; to the <emphasis>permissive</emphasis> mode that does
      not enforce &selnx; policies but still logs offences against them called
      <emphasis>Access Vector Rules</emphasis> (AVCs).
    </para>
    <para>
      To set &selnx; to the permissive mode temporarily, run:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;setenforce 0</screen>
    <tip>
      <para>
        To set &selnx; to the permissive mode permanently, edit
        <filename>/etc/selinux/config</filename> and update it to include the
        following line:
      </para>
<screen>SELINUX=permissive</screen>
    </tip>
    <important>
      <para>
        If you entered an &selnx; permissive mode, you need to relabel your
        system until it is back in a good state. The reason is that the
        permissive mode allows you to reach states that are not reachable
        otherwise. To relabel the system, run the following command and reboot
        the system:
      </para>
<screen>
&prompt.root;touch /etc/selinux/.autorelabel
&prompt.root;reboot
</screen>
    </important>
    <para>
      To monitor AVCs, search the Audit log and &systemd; journal for log
      messages similar to the following one:
    </para>
<screen>
type=AVC msg=audit(1669971354.731:25): avc:  denied  { create } \
for pid=1264 comm="ModemManager" scontext=system_u:system_r:modemmanager_t:s0 \
tcontext=system_u:system_r:modemmanager_t:s0 tclass=qipcrtr_socket permissive=0
</screen>
    <para>
      To filter such messages, you can use the following commands:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;tail -f /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep -i AVC</screen>
    <para>
      and
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;journalctl -f | grep -i AVC</screen>
    <para>
      For more advanced search, use the following command:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;ausearch -m avc,user_avc,selinux_err -i</screen>
    <para>
      If such messages appear while using the application that did not behave
      correctly when &selnx; was set to the enforce mode, the policies are
      probably too restrictive and need updating. You can help to fine-tune
      &selnx; policies by creating a bug report at
      <link xlink:href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=SUSE%20ALP%20-%20SUSE%20Adaptable%20Linux%20Platform"/>.
      Specify <literal>Basesystem</literal> as a component, include the word
      <literal>&selnx;</literal> in the bug subject, and attach the gathered
      unique lines that include AVCs together with reproduction steps.
